#Computer 
In [[computer science]], a linked list is a [[line]]ar collection of [[data]] elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in [[memory]]. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of [[node]]s which together represent a [[sequence]].
