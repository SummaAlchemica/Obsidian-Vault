#Physics 
In [[Physic]], motion is the phenomenon in which an [[object]] changes its [[position]] with respect to [[time]]. Motion is [[math]]ematically described in terms of [[displace]]ment, [[distance]], [[velocity]], [[acceleration]], [[speed]] and frame of reference to an [[observe]]r and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame with change in time. The branch of physics describing the motion of objects without reference to its cause is called [[kinematic]]s, while the branch studying forces and their effect on motion is called [[dynamic]]s.

If an object is not moving relative to a given frame of reference, the object is said to be at rest, [[motion]]less, immobile, stationary, or to have a [[constant]] or time-invariant position with reference to its surroundings. Modern physics holds that, as there is no absolute frame of reference, [[Newton]]'s concept of absolute motion cannot be determined.[1] As such, everything in the [[universe]] can be considered to be in motion.[2]: 20–21 

Motion applies to various physical systems: objects, [[bodies]], [[matter]] [[particle]]s, [[matter field]]s, [[radiation]], [[radiation field]]s, [[radiation particle]]s, [[curvature]], and [[space-time]]. One can also speak on the motion of [[image]]s, [[shape]]s, and boundaries. In general, the term motion signifies a continuous change in the positions or configuration of a physical system in [[space]]. For example, one can talk about the motion of a [[wave]] or the motion of a [[quantum particle]], where the configuration consists of probabilities of the wave or particle occupying specific positions.
