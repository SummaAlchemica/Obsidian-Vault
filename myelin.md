Myelin is a [[lipid]]-rich material that surrounds [[nerve]] [[cell]] [[axon]]s (the [[nervous system]]'s "wires") to insulate them and increase the rate at which electrical impulses (called action potentials) are passed along the axon.[1] The myelinated axon can be likened to an [[electric]]al wire (the axon) with insulating material (myelin) around it. However, unlike the plastic covering on an electrical wire, myelin does not form a single long sheath over the entire length of the axon. Rather, myelin sheaths the nerve in segments: in general, each axon is encased with multiple long myelinated sections with short gaps in between called [[nodes of Ranvier]].

Myelin is formed in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS; [[brain]], [[spinal cord]] and [[optic nerve]]) by [[glial cell]]s called [[oligodendrocyte]]s and in the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) by glial cells called [[Schwann cell]]s. In the CNS, axons carry electrical signals from one nerve cell body to another. In the PNS, axons carry signals to [[muscle]]s and glands or from sensory organs such as the skin. Each myelin sheath is formed by the concentric wrapping of an oligodendrocyte (CNS) or Schwann cell (PNS) process (a limb-like extension from the cell body) around the axon.[2][3] Myelin reduces the [[capacitance]] of the axonal [[membrane]]. On a molecular level, in the internodes it increases the distance between [[extracellular]] and [[intracellular]] [[ion]]s, reducing the accumulation of charges. The discontinuous structure of the myelin sheath results in [[saltatory conduction]], whereby the [[action potential]] "jumps" from one node of Ranvier, over a long myelinated stretch of the axon called the [[internode]], before "recharging" at the next node of Ranvier, and so on, until it reaches the axon terminal.[4][5][6] Nodes of Ranvier are the short (c. 1 [[micron]]) unmyelinated regions of the axon between adjacent long (c. 0.2 mm â€“ >1 mm) myelinated internodes. Once it reaches the axon terminal, this electrical signal provokes the release of a chemical message or [[neurotransmitter]] that binds to [[receptor]]s on the adjacent [[post-synaptic cell]] (e.g., nerve cell in the CNS or muscle cell in the PNS) at specialised regions called [[synapse]]s.
