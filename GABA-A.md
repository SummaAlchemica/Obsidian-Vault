The GABAA receptor (GABAAR) is an [[ionotropic receptor]] and [[ligand-gated]] [[ion channel]]. Its endogenous ligand is [[γ-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), the major [[inhibit]]ory [[neurotransmitter]] in the [[CNS]] central nervous system. Upon opening, the GABAA receptor on the [[postsynaptic cell]] is [[selectively permeable]] to [[chloride]] ions (Cl−) and, to a lesser extent, [[bicarbonate]] ions (HCO3−).[1][2] Depending on the [[membrane]] potential and the ionic concentration difference, this can result in ionic fluxes across the pore. If the membrane potential is higher than the [[equilibrium]] potential (also known as the [[reversal potential]]) for chloride ions, when the receptor is activated Cl− will flow into the cell.[3] This causes an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission by diminishing the chance of a successful action potential occurring at the postsynaptic cell. The reversal potential of the GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in normal solution is −70 mV, contrasting the GABAB IPSP (-100 mV).

The active site of the GABAA receptor is the binding site for GABA and several drugs such as [[muscimol]], [[gaboxadol]], and [[bicuculline]].[4] The [[protein]] also contains a number of different allosteric binding sites which modulate the activity of the receptor indirectly. These allosteric sites are the targets of various other [[drug]]s, including the [[benzodiazepine]]s, nonbenzodiazepines, neuroactive steroids, barbiturates, alcohol (ethanol),[5] inhaled anaesthetics, kavalactones, cicutoxin, and picrotoxin, among others.[6]

GABAA receptors occur in all organisms that have a [[nervous system]]. To a limited extent the receptors can be found in non-neuronal tissues. Due to their wide distribution within the nervous system of mammals they play a role in virtually all brain functions.
