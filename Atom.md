An atom isÂ **a [[particle]] of [[matter]] that uniquely defines a chemical [[element]]**. An atom consists of a central nucleus that is surrounded by one or more negatively charged [[electron]]s. The nucleus is positively charged and contains one or more relatively heavy particles known as [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s.
