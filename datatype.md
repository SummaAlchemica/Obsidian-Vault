#Computer 
In [[computer science]] and [[computer program]]ming, a data type (or simply type) is a collection or grouping of [[data]] [[value]]s, usually specified by a [[set]] of possible values, a set of allowed [[operation]]s on these values, and/or a representation of these values as [[machine types]].[1] A data type specification in a program constrains the possible values that an expression, such as a [[variable]] or a [[function]] call, might take. On literal data, it tells the [[compile]]r or [[interpret]]er how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support basic data types of [[integer]] [[number]]s (of varying sizes), [[floating-point]] numbers (which approximate real numbers), [[character (ling)]]s and [[Boolean]]s.[2][3]
