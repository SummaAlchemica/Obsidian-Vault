#Astronomy 
An astronomical [[object]], celestial object, stellar object or heavenly body is a naturally occurring physical [[entity]], association, or [[structure]] that exists within the [[observable universe]].[1] In [[astronomy]], the terms object and body are often used interchangeably. However, an astronomical body or celestial body is a single, tightly bound, contiguous entity, while an astronomical or celestial object is a complex, less cohesively bound structure, which may consist of multiple bodies or even other objects with [[substructure]]s.

Examples of astronomical objects include [[planetary system]]s, [[star cluster]]s, [[nebula]]e, and galaxies [[galaxy]], while [[asteroid]]s, [[moon]]s, planets, and [[star]]s are astronomical bodies. A [[comet]] may be identified as both body and object: It is a body when referring to the frozen [[nucleus]] of [[ice]] and [[dust]], and an object when describing the entire comet with its diffuse [[coma]] and [[comet tail]].
