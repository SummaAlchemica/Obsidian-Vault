The midbrain or mesencephalon is the forward-most portion of the [[brainstem]] and is associated with [[vision]], [[hearing]], [[motor control]], [[sleep]] and wakefulness, [[arousal]] (alertness), and [[temperature regulation]].[2] The name comes from the Greek mesos, "middle", and enkephalos, "brain".[3]

Structure

The principal regions of the midbrain are the [[tectum]], the [[cerebral aqueduct]], [[tegmentum]], and the [[cerebral peduncles]]. Rostrally the midbrain adjoins the [[diencephalon]] ([[thalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], etc.), while caudally it adjoins the [[hindbrain]] ([[pons]], [[medulla]] and [[cerebellum]]).[4] In the rostral direction, the midbrain noticeably splays laterally.

Sectioning of the midbrain is usually performed axially, at one of two levels â€“ that of the [[superior colliculi]], or that of the [[inferior colliculi]]. One common technique for remembering the structures of the midbrain involves visualizing these cross-sections (especially at the level of the superior colliculi) as the upside-down face of a bear, with the cerebral peduncles forming the ears, the cerebral aqueduct the mouth, and the tectum the chin; prominent features of the tegmentum form the eyes and certain sculptural shadows of the face.
