#Biology 
The front lever is a [[gymnastic]] and [[calisthenic]] move - a [[static]] hold normally performed on the still [[rings]] or the [[pull up]] bar. A front lever is performed by lowering from an inverted hang until the body is completely [[horizontal]] and straight with the front of the [[body]] facing upwards.
