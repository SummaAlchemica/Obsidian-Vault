[[Quantum]] [[cellular automata]] (QCA) is an [[abstract]] [[model]] of [[quantum computation]], devised in analogy to conventional models of cellular automata introduced by John [[von Neumann]]. The same name may also refer to quantum dot cellular automata, which are a proposed physical implementation of "classical" cellular automata by exploiting quantum mechanical phenomena. QCA have attracted a lot of attention as a result of its extremely small feature size (at the molecular or even [[atom]]ic scale) and its ultra-low power consumption, making it one candidate for replacing [[CMOS]] technology.
