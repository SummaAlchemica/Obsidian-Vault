#Computer 
In [[computer]] [[programming]], homoiconicity (from the Greek words homo- meaning "the same" and icon meaning "representation") is a property of some [[programming language]]s. A [[language]] is homoiconic if a [[program]] written in it can be manipulated as [[data]] using the language, and thus the program's internal representation can be inferred just by reading the program itself. This property is often summarized by saying that the language treats [[code]] as data.

In a homoiconic language, the primary representation of programs is also a data structure in a primitive type of the language itself. This makes metaprogramming easier than in a language without this property: reflection in the language (examining the program's entities at runtime) depends on a single, homogeneous structure, and it does not have to handle several different structures that would appear in a complex syntax. Homoiconic languages typically include full support of syntactic macros, allowing the programmer to express transformations of programs in a concise way.

A commonly cited example is Lisp, which was created to allow for easy list manipulations and where the structure is given by S-expressions that take the form of nested lists, and can be manipulated by other Lisp code.[1] Other examples are the programming languages Clojure (a contemporary dialect of Lisp), Rebol (also its successor Red), Refal, Prolog, and possibly Julia (see the section “Implementation methods” for more details).
