[Typography](https://learn.g2.com/typography)is the [[art]] and technique of arranging type to make [[writ]]ten [[language]] legible, readable and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting [[typeface]]s, [[point size]]s, [[line length]]s, [[line-spacing]], and [[letter-spacing]], as well as adjusting the space between pairs of [[letter]]s.

Relavent terms: 
#### **Baseline**

The bottom, invisible line where text, letters, and characters sit.

#### **Cap line**

The top, invisible line that acts as an upper boundary for text, letters, and characters.

#### **X-height**

The height of a certain font’s lowercase letters (with the exception of ascenders, like the letter h, or descenders, like the letter p).

#### **Tracking**

The amount of space between letters in a block of text (sometimes referred to as “letter spacing”).

#### **Leading**

The vertical space between each line of text.

#### **Kerning**

An adjustment that either extends or lessens the space between two letters or other characters.


Rules of typography: 
### **1. Use a maximum of three fonts per design**

Too many fonts can get visually overwhelming. If you want your designs to be cohesive, choose a maximum of three fonts — one for the header text, one for the sub-header text, and one for the body text. (Using one or two fonts is also fine.)

### **2. Choose distinctive fonts**

If you’re going to use more than one font in a design, make sure each is distinctive enough to stand on its own. Choosing two fonts that are too similar — and are too challenging to differentiate from each other — can come across as a mistake instead of a deliberate design decision. Remember, [font pairing](https://learn.g2.com/font-pairing) is an art and a science. 

### **3. Use text hierarchy**

We already covered the importance of text hierarchy, but just to reiterate — it’s important to use text hierarchy to convey importance in your designs. Text hierarchy dictates how the viewer is going to receive the information in your design. So, if you have an important piece of information, make sure it’s larger than the other text in your design and easy for your viewer to identify.

### **4. Be aware of spacing**

Tracking, leading, and kerning have a huge impact on the final feel of your design. For example, having a significant amount of space between letters is going to create a completely different look and feel rather than grouping letters closely together. Make sure the way you’re spacing your typography — both between letters and between lines — fits with the overall design aesthetic you’re trying to create.
