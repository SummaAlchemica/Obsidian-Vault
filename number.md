#Math 
A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers [[0]], [[1]], [[2]], [[3]], [[4]], [[5]], [[6]], [[7]], [[8]], [[9]] and so forth.[1] Numbers can be represented in [[language]] with [[number word]]s. More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called [[numeral]]s; for example, "5" is a numeral that represents the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a [[numeral system]], which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental [[numeric symbol]]s, called [[digit]]s.[2][a] In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents.

In mathematics, the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include zero (0),[3] [[negative number]]s,[4] [[rational number]]s such as one half, [[real number]]s such as the [[square root]] of 2 and π,[5] and [[complex number]]s[6] which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples).[4] Calculations with numbers are done with [[arithmet]]ical operations, the most familiar being [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[division]], and [[exponent]]iation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to [[number theory]], the study of the properties of numbers.

Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world.[7][8] For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and "a [[million]]" may signify "a lot" rather than an exact quantity.[7] Though it is now regarded as [[pseudoscience]], belief in a [[mystic]]al significance of numbers, known as [[numerology]], permeated [[ancient]] and [[medieval]] thought.[9] Numerology heavily influenced the development of [[Greek]] mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.[9]
