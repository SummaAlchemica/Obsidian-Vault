A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a [[Comput]] system. A database is usually controlled by aÂ [[database management system]]. Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language ([[SQL]]) for writing and querying data.
