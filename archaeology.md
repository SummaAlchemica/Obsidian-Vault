Economic [[botany]] is the study of the relationship between people (individuals and cultures) and plants. Economic botany intersects many fields including established disciplines such as [[agronomy]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], chemistry, economics, [[ethnobotany]], ethnology, forestry, genetic resources, geography, geology, horticulture, medicine, microbiology, nutrition, pharmacognosy, and pharmacology.[1] This link between botany and anthropology explores the ways humans use plants for food, medicines, and commerce.[2]
