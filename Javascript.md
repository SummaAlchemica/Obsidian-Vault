Javascript is a [[Programming language]] which allows a user to make elements of a [[Webpage]] interactive. It is a high level language and is easy to learn because of its simple [[Synta]]x and widespread usage on the internet. It can be used with [[HTML]] and [[CSS]] to make functional and beautiful pages.

**JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the** [**WWW**](https://www.stackscale.com/blog/world-wide-web-anniversary/), together with HTML and CSS. It was initially developed by the American computer programmer Brendan Eich, at Netscape, in 1995. It is a must-have among software developers and a great starting point for beginners.

JavaScript must not be confused with [[Java]], although both of them have a C-like [[Synta]] and JS was designed with Java’s syntax and standard library in mind. JavaScript and Java are actually very different:
