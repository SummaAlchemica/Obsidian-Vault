Electrical discharge [[machining]], also known as [[spark]] machining, spark eroding, die sinking, wire burning or wire [[erosion]], is a [[metal]] [[fabricat]]ion process whereby a desired shape is obtained by using [[electric]]al discharges. Material is removed from the work piece by a series of rapidly recurring [[current]] discharges between two [[electrode]]s, separated by a [[dielectric]] [[liquid]] and subject to an electric [[volt]]age. One of the electrodes is called the tool-electrode, or simply the tool or electrode, while the other is called the workpiece-electrode, or work piece. The process depends upon the tool and work piece not making physical contact. When the voltage between the two electrodes is increased, the intensity of the [[electric field]] in the volume between the electrodes becomes greater, causing dielectric break down of the liquid, and produces an electric arc. As a result, material is removed from the electrodes.
