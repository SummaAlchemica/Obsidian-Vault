#Computer #Language 
Java is a [[high-level]], [[class-based]], [[object-oriented]] programming [[language]] that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

**Java**Â was originally designed by the Canadian computer scientist James Gosling, while working at Sun Microsystems, in 1995. It is a particularly popular [[programming language]] for server-client web applications. Although it was initially released under proprietary license, it is currently available under [[GNU]] GPL 2.0-only license.
