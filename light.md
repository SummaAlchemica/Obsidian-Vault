#Physics 
Light or visible light is [[electromagnetic]] [[radiation]] that can be perceived by the [[human]] [[eye]].[1] Visible light is usually defined as having [[wavelength]]s in the range of 400–700 [[nanometre]]s (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz, between the [[infrared]] (with longer wavelengths) and the [[ultraviolet]] (with shorter wavelengths).[2][3]

In physics, the term "light" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.[4][5] In this sense, [[gamma]] rays, [[X-ray]]s, [[microwave]]s and [[radio]] [[wave]]s are also light. The primary properties of light are [[intensity]], [[propagation direction]], [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]] [[spectrum]] and [[polarization]]. Its [[speed]] in [[vacuum]], 299792458 m/s, is one of the fundamental [[constant]]s of nature.[6] Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by [[massless]] [[elementary particle]]s called [[photon]]s that represents the quanta of electromagnetic [[field]], and can be analyzed as both waves and [[particle]]s. The study of light, known as [[optic]]s, is an important research area in modern physics.

The main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been [[fire]], from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.
