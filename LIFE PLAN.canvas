I have given thousands of technical and cultural interviews over the years. The three biggest misconceptions/mistakes I see from entry-level applicants:\n\n1. They grossly over-estimate what is expected for an entry-level developer to know. We aren't looking for perfection, we're looking for a basic understanding of the job you're applying for, and an expressed desire to learn. So many applicants graduated 6+ months earlier and haven't touched programming since, and can't even explain a for loop. It's shocking. That's almost always a no go. Keep learning.\n\n2. No bullshitters. You cannot bullshit in this field. The technical questions are black and white, A or B. There is no gray area, and we already know the answers. If you start trying to lie and make things up, you will not get the job.\n\n3. Professionalism. You can be a rock-star technically, but there is more to being a professional developer than sitting there hammering out code all day. You need to be able to communicate clearly with business and other teams that may not have a technical background. You need to be able to prioritize and multitask. You will always be juggling multiple things. Colleagues and management will definitely help you, but you have to bring something to the table too. WORK ON YOUR SOFT SKILLS! I volunteer each semester to give mock interviews at the university here. Soft skills are almost always among the weakest of a new graduate's skillset.\nAsk questions: \n-What type and size of team would I be working with? \n-What kind of version control do you use?\n-What is the pull request process\nWhat kind of integration and deployment system do you use?\n-Don't ask about benefits and pay: they should be outlined already.\n-What's one thing that suprised you when you started working here. \n-If you were in charge of the company what's one thing you would change immediately.
