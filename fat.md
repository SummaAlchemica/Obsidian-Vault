In [[nutrition]], [[biolog]]y, and [[chemistry]], fat usually means any [[ester]] of [[fatty acid]]s, or a mixture of such compounds, most commonly those that occur in living beings or in food.[1]

The term often refers specifically to [[triglyceride]]s (triple esters of [[glycerol]]), that are the main components of vegetable oils and of fatty [[tissue]] in [[animal]]s;[2] or, even more narrowly, to triglycerides that are solid or semisolid at room temperature, thus excluding oils. The term may also be used more broadly as a synonym of lipidâ€”any substance of biological relevance, composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], or [[oxygen]], that is [[insoluble]] in water but [[soluble]] in [[non-polar]] s[[olvent]]s.[1] In this sense, besides the triglycerides, the term would include several other types of compounds like mono- and [[diglyceride]]s, [[phospholipid]]s (such as [[lecithin]]), [[sterol]]s (such as [[cholesterol]]), [[wax]]es (such as beeswax),[1] and [[free fatty acid]]s, which are usually present in human diet in smaller amounts.[2]
