A [[Linux]] distribution[a] (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux [[kernel]], and often a package management system. Linux users usually obtain their [[operating system]] by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, [[OpenWrt]]) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to powerful [[supercomputer]]s (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).

A typical Linux distribution comprises a Linux kernel, [[GNU]] tools and libraries, additional software, documentation, a window system (the most common being the X Window System, or, more recently, Wayland), a window manager, and a desktop environment.

Most of the included software is free and open-source software made available both as compiled binaries and in source code form, allowing modifications to the original software. Usually, Linux distributions optionally include some proprietary software that may not be available in source code form, such as binary blobs required for some device drivers.[1]

A Linux distribution may also be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet many users' needs.[2] The software is usually adapted to the distribution and then combined into software packages by the distribution's maintainers. The software packages are available online in repositories, which are storage locations usually distributed around the world.[3][4] Beside "glue" components, such as the distribution installers (for example, Debian-Installer and Anaconda) and the package management systems, very few packages are actually written by a distribution's maintainers.

Almost one thousand Linux distributions exist.[5][6] Because of the huge availability of software, distributions have taken a wide variety of forms, including those suitable for use on desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones and tablets,[7][8] as well as in minimal environments typically for use in embedded systems.[9][10] There are commercially backed distributions, such as Fedora Linux (Red Hat), openSUSE (SUSE) and Ubuntu (Canonical Ltd.); and entirely community-driven distributions, such as Debian, Slackware, Gentoo and Arch Linux. Most distributions come ready-to-use and precompiled for a specific instruction set, while some (such as Gentoo) are distributed mostly in source code form and must be compiled locally for installation.[11]
