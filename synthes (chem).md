#Chemistry 
In [[chemistry]], chemical synthesis (chemical combination) is the artificial execution of [[chemical reaction]]s to obtain one or several products.[1] This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern laboratory uses, the process is reproducible and reliable.

A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds (known as reagents or [[reactant]]s) that will experience a [[transform]]ation when subjected to certain conditions. Various reaction types can be applied to formulate a desired product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel, such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom [[Flask (comp)]]. Many reactions require some form of processing ("work-up") or [[purif]]ication procedure to isolate the final product.[1]

The amount produced by chemical synthesis is known as the [[reaction yield]]. Typically, yields are expressed as a [[mass]] in [[gram]]s (in a laboratory setting) or as a percentage of the total [[theor]]etical quantity that could be produced based on the limiting reagent. A side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction occurring which reduces the desired yield. The word synthesis was used first in a chemical context by the chemist Hermann Kolbe.[2]
