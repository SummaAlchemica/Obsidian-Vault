A brain is an [[organ]] that serves as the center of the [[nervous system]] in all [[vertebrate]] and most [[invertebrate]] [[animal]]s. It is located in the head, usually close to the [[sensory]] organs for senses such as [[vision]]. It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a [[human]], the [[cerebral cortex]] contains approximately 14–16 billion [[neurons]],[1] and the estimated number of neurons in the [[cerebellum]] is 55–70 billion.[2] Each neuron is connected by [[synapses]] to several thousand other neurons. These neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called [[axons]], which carry trains of [[signal]] pulses called [[action potential]]s to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific [[recipient cell]]s.

Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs. They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of [[muscle]] activity and by driving the [[secretion]] of [[chemicals]] called [[hormones]]. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the [[environment]]. Some basic types of responsiveness such as [[reflex]]es can be mediated by the [[spinal cord]] or [[peripheral ganglia]], but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.

The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.[3] Recent models in modern [[neuroscience]] treat the brain as a biological [[Comput]], very different in mechanism from an [[electronic]] computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires [[definition]] from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.
