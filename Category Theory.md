Category theory formalizes [[math]]ematical structure and its concepts in terms of a labeled directed [[graph]] called a category, whose [[node]]s are called objects, and whose labelled directed [[edge]]s are called arrows. A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively, and the existence of an identity arrow for each object. The language of category theory has been used to formalize concepts of other high-level abstractions such as [[set]]s, [[ring]]s, and [[group]]s. Informally, category theory is a general theory of functions. Several terms used in category theory, including the term "morphism", are used differently from their uses in the rest of mathematics. In category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself.
