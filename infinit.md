#Math 
Infinity is that which is boundless, endless, or larger than any [[natural number]]. It is often denoted by the infinity [[symbol]] 
∞\infty .

Since the time of the ancient [[Greek]]s, the philosophical nature of infinity was the subject of many discussions among philosophers. In the [[17th century]], with the introduction of the infinity symbol[1] and the [[infinitesimal calculus]], [[math]]ematicians began to work with [[infinite series]] and what some mathematicians (including l'Hôpital and Bernoulli)[2] regarded as infinitely small quantities, but infinity continued to be associated with endless processes. As mathematicians struggled with the foundation of [[calculus]], it remained unclear whether infinity could be considered as a number or magnitude and, if so, how this could be done.[1] At the end of the 19th century, [[Georg Cantor]] enlarged the mathematical study of infinity by studying infinite sets and infinite numbers, showing that they can be of various sizes.[1][3] For example, if a line is viewed as the set of all of its points, their infinite number (i.e., the [[cardinal]]ity of the [[line]]) is larger than the number of [[integer]]s.[4] In this usage, infinity is a mathematical concept, and infinite mathematical objects can be studied, manipulated, and used just like any other mathematical [[object]].

The mathematical [[concept]] of infinity refines and extends the old philosophical concept, in particular by introducing infinitely many different sizes of infinite sets. Among the [[axiom]]s of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], on which most of modern mathematics can be developed, is the axiom of infinity, which guarantees the existence of infinite sets.[1] The mathematical concept of infinity and the manipulation of infinite sets are used everywhere in mathematics, even in areas such as [[combinatoric]]s that may seem to have nothing to do with them. For example,[[ Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]] implicitly relies on the existence of very large [[infinite set]]s[5] for solving a long-standing problem that is stated in terms of elementary [[arithmetic]].

In [[Physic]] and [[cosmology]], whether the [[Universe]] is spatially infinite is an open question.
