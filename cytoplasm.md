#Biology 
In cell biology, the cytoplasm is all of the material within a [[eukaryotic]] [[cell]], enclosed by the cell membrane, except for the cell [[nucleus]]. The material inside the nucleus and contained within the nuclear [[membrane]] is termed the [[nucleoplasm]]. The main components of the cytoplasm are [[cytosol]] (a gel-like substance), the [[organelle]]s (the cell's internal sub-structures), and various cytoplasmic inclusions. The cytoplasm is about 80% [[water]] and is usually colorless.[1]

The [[submicroscopic]] ground cell substance or cytoplasmic matrix which remains after exclusion of the cell organelles and particles is [[groundplasm]]. It is the [[hyaloplasm]] of [[light]] [[microscop]]y, a highly complex, [[polyphasic]] system in which all resolvable cytoplasmic elements are suspended, including the larger organelles such as the [[ribosome]]s, [[mitochondria]], the plant [[plastids]], [[lipid]] droplets, and [[vacuole]]s.

Most cellular activities take place within the cytoplasm, such as many metabolic pathways including [[glycolysis]], and processes such as [[cell division]]. The concentrated inner area is called the [[endoplasm]] and the outer layer is called the [[cell cortex]] or the [[ectoplasm]].

Movement of [[calcium]] [[ion]]s in and out of the cytoplasm is a signaling activity for metabolic processes.[2]

In plants, movement of the cytoplasm around vacuoles is known as [[cytoplasmic stream]]ing.
