Benzodiazepines (also called “benzos”) are a class of agents that work in the [[CNS]] central nervous system and are used for a variety of medical conditions.

They act on specific receptors in the brain, called gamma-aminobutyric acid-A ([[GABA-A]]) [[receptor]]s. Benzodiazepines attach to these receptors and make the [[nerve]]s in the brain less sensitive to [[stimul]]ation, which has a calming effect.
