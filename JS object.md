[[JavaScript]] is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of [properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Property/JavaScript), and a property is an association between a name (or _key_) and a value. A property's value can be a [[function]], in which case the property is known as a [[method]].

Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
