#Linguistics 
Historical [[linguistic]]s, also termed diachronic linguistics, is the scientific study of language change over [[time]]. Principal concerns of [[histor]]ical linguistics include: 1. to describe and account for observed changes in particular languages 2. to reconstruct the pre-history of languages and to determine their relatedness, grouping them into [[language famil]]ies 3. to develop general theories about how and why language changes 4. to describe the history of [[speech]] communities 5. to study the history of words, i.e. [[etymology]].
