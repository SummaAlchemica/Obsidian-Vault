Syntactically speaking, Objective C is an extension of the popular [[C (programming language)]] programming language. This means knowing C will definitely help you learn Objective C.

One of the key differences between Objective C and C is that Objective C has an [[Object-oriented]] class system not present in C. If you know C but have no experience in object-oriented programming (OOP), you’ll need to learn the object-oriented class system in Objective C.

C has been around since 1970 and is the grandmother of many of the most popular programming languages in use today. This is why you see features of C in other programming languages, such as [[C++]] and Objective C. When it comes to usage, C is a general-purpose [[language]] for [[Unix]] systems. A typical use case for C is to build system applications and desktop apps.

Objective C is also a general-purpose programming language with an object-oriented edge to it. The primary use case for Objective C is building [[iOS]] apps and [[macOS]] applications.
