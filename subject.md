#Linguistics 
The subject in a simple [[English]] [[sentence]] such as John runs, John is a teacher, or John drives a car, is the person or thing about whom the statement is made, in this case John. Traditionally the subject is the word or [[phrase]] which controls the verb in the [[clause]], that is to say with which the [[verb]] agrees.

A subject is a being who has a unique [[conscious]]ness and/or unique personal experiences, or an entity that has a relationship with another [[entity]] that exists outside itself (called an "[[object]]").

A subject is an observer and an object is a [[thing]] observed. This concept is especially important in [[Continental philosophy]], where 'the subject' is a central term in debates over the nature of the [[self]].[1] The nature of the subject is also central in debates over the nature of subjective experience within the Anglo-American tradition of analytical philosophy.

The sharp distinction between subject and object corresponds to the distinction, in the [[philosophy]] of [[Ren√© Descartes]], between [[thought]] and [[extension]]. Descartes believed that thought (subjectivity) was the essence of the mind, and that extension (the occupation of [[space]]) was the essence of matter.[2]
