#Computer 
Processor design is a subfield of [[computer engineering]] and [[electronics engineering]] ([[fabricat]]ion) that deals with creating a [[processor]], a key component of [[computer]] [[hardware]].

The design process involves choosing an [[instruction set]] and a certain execution paradigm (e.g. [[VLIW]] or [[RISC]]) and results in a [[microarchitecture]], which might be described in e.g. [[VHDL]] or [[Verilog]]. For microprocessor design, this description is then manufactured employing some of the various [[semiconductor]] device fabrication processes, resulting in a die which is bonded onto a chip carrier. This chip carrier is then [[solder]]ed onto, or inserted into a socket on, a printed circuit board ([[PCB]]).

The mode of operation of any processor is the execution of lists of instructions. Instructions typically include those to compute or manipulate [[data]] values using [[register]]s, change or retrieve values in read/write memory, perform relational tests between data values and to control [[program flow]].

Processor designs are often tested and validated on one or several [[FPGA]]s before sending the design of the processor to a foundry for semiconductor fabrication.[1]
