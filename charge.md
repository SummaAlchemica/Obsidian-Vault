#Physics 
Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes matter to experience a [[force]] when placed in an [[electromagnet]]ic field. Electric charge can be [[positive]] or [[negative]] (commonly carried by [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s respectively, by convention). Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other.
