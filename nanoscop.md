Super-resolution microscopy is a series of techniques in [[optical]] [[microscop]]y that allow such images to have [[resolution]]s higher than those imposed by the diffraction limit,[1][2] which is due to the diffraction of light.[3] Super-resolution imaging techniques rely on the near-field (photon-tunneling microscopy[4] as well as those that utilize the Pendry Superlens and near field scanning optical microscopy) or on the far-field. Among techniques that rely on the latter are those that improve the resolution only modestly (up to about a factor of two) beyond the [[diffraction]]-limit, such as [[confocal]] microscopy with closed pinhole or aided by computational methods such as [[deconvolution]][5] or detector-based [[pixel]] reassignment (e.g. re-scan microscopy,[6] pixel reassignment[7]), the 4Pi microscope, and [[structured-illumination microscopy]] technologies such as SIM[8][9] and SMI.

There are two major groups of methods for super-resolution microscopy in the far-field that can improve the resolution by a much larger factor:[10]

[[Determin]]istic super-resolution: the most commonly used emitters in [[biolog]]ical microscopy, [[fluorophore]]s, show a [[nonlinear]] response to excitation, which can be exploited to enhance resolution. Such methods include [[STED]], [[GSD]], [[RESOLFT]] and [[SSIM]].
Stochastic super-resolution: the chemical complexity of many molecular light sources gives them a complex temporal behavior, which can be used to make several nearby fluorophores emit light at separate times and thereby become resolvable in time. These methods include Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) and all single-molecule localization methods (SMLM), such as SPDM, SPDMphymod, PALM, FPALM, STORM, and dSTORM.
On 8 October 2014, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig, W.E. Moerner and Stefan Hell for "the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy", which brings "optical microscopy into the nanodimension".[11][12] The different modalities of super-resolution microscopy are increasingly being adopted by the biomedical research community, and these techniques are becoming indispensable tools to understanding biological function at the molecular level.[13]
