#Computer 

C [[Language]] is a [[Programming language]] which is most commonly used to create [[Operating System]]s and other [[Software]] which requires efficient usage of [[Comput]] power. It allows for the manipulation of registers and individual bits which gives the programmer greater control than [[high level]] [[language]]s such as [[C (programming language)#]], [[C++]], and [[Python]].

**C** is a [[general-purpose]] programming language, originally designed by the American computer scientist Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s. It stands out for the efficiency of its code. C is widely used for developing [[system software]], creating applications and on a wide range of [[computer architecture]]s — from [[Supercomputer]]s to [[embedded systems]].
