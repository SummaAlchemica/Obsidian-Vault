In [[typography]], a serif is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger stroke in a [[letter]] or [[symbol]] within a particular [[font]] or family of fonts. A typeface or "[[font family]]" making use of serifs is called a [[serif typeface]], and a typeface that does not include them is [[sans-serif]].
