#Engineering A [[rocket]]-propelled grenade is a shoulder-fired [[missile]] [[weapon]] that launches rockets equipped with an [[explosive]] [[warhead]]. Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier, and are frequently used as anti-tank weapons. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable with new rocket-propelled grenades, while others are single-use. RPGs are generally loaded from the front. RPGs with high-explosive anti-tank warheads are very effective against lightly armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers and armored cars. However, modern, heavily-armored vehicles, such as upgraded APCs and main battle tanks, are generally too well-protected to be penetrated by an RPG, unless less armored sections of the vehicle are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems and other unarmored targets.
