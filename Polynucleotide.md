#Chemistry 
In molecular [[biolog]]y, a polynucleotide is a [[biopolymer]] composed of 13 or more [[nucleotide]] [[monomer]]s, [[covalent]]ly bonded in a chain. [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] are examples of polynucleotides with distinct biological functions. DNA consists of two chains of polynucleotides, with each chain in the form of a [[helix]].
