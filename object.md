#Physics 
In common usage and [[classical mechanics]], a physical object or physical body (or simply an object or body) is a collection of matter within a defined contiguous boundary in [[three-dimensional space]].[citation needed] The boundary must be defined and identified by the properties of the material. The boundary may change over time. The boundary is usually the visible or tangible surface of the object. The matter in the object is constrained (to a greater or lesser degree) to move as one object. The boundary may move in [[space]] [[relative]] to other objects that it is not attached to (through [[translation]] and [[rotation]]). An object's boundary may also [[deform]] and change over [[time]] in other ways.

Also in common usage, an object is not constrained to consist of the same collection of [[matter]]. [[Atom]]s or parts of an object may change over time. An object usually meant to be defined by the simplest representation of the boundary consistent with the observations. However the laws of [[Physic]] only apply directly to objects that consist of the same collection of matter.
