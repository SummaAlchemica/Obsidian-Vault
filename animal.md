#Biology  
Animals are [[multicellular]], [[eukaryotic]] [[organism]]s in the biological [[kingdom]] [[Animalia]]. With few exceptions, animals consume [[organic]] material, breathe [[oxygen]], are able to move, can reproduce [[sex]]ually, and grow from a hollow sphere of [[cell]]s, the [[blastula]], during [[embryo]]nic development. As of 2022, 2.16 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are [[insect]]s, over 85,000 are [[mollusc]]s, and around 65,000 are [[vertebrate]]s—but it has been estimated there are around 7.77 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as [[zoology]].
