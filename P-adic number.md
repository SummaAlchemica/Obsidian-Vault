#Math 
In mathematics, the p-adic [[number system]] for any [[prime number]] p extends the ordinary [[arithmetic]] of the [[rational number]]s in a different way from the extension of the rational number system to the real and [[complex number]] systems. The extension is achieved by an alternative interpretation of the concept of "closeness" or [[absolute value]].
