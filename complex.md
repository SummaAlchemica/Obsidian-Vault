Complexity characterises the behaviour of a [[system]] or [[model]] whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, leading to [[nonlinear]]ity, randomness, [[collective dynamics]], [[hierarchy]], and [[emergence]].[1][2]

The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of emergence greater than the sum of its parts. The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of [[complex systems theory]].

The intuitive criterion of complexity can be formulated as follows: a system would be more complex if more parts could be distinguished, and if more connections between them existed.[3]

As of 2010, a number of approaches to characterizing complexity have been used in science; Zayed et al.[4] reflect many of these. Neil Johnson states that "even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity â€“ and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..." Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of "complexity science" as "the study of the [[phenomena]] which emerge from a collection of interacting objects".[5]
