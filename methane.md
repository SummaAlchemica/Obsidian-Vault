#Chemistry 
Methane (US: /ˈmɛθeɪn/ MEH-thayn, UK: /ˈmiːθeɪn/ MEE-thayn) is a [[chemical]] [[compound]] with the chemical formula CH4 (one [[carbon]] [[atom]] bonded to four [[hydrogen]] atoms). It is a [[group-14]] [[hydride]], the simplest [[alkane]], and the main constituent of [[natural gas]]. The relative abundance of methane on [[Earth]] makes it an economically attractive [[fuel]], although capturing and storing it poses technical challenges due to its [[gas]]eous state under normal conditions for [[temperature]] and [[pressure]].

Naturally occurring methane is found both below ground and under the seafloor and is formed by both geological and biological processes. The largest reservoir of methane is under the seafloor in the form of [[methane clathrate]]s. When methane reaches the surface and the [[atmosphere]], it is known as atmospheric methane.[9]

The Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 260% since 1750—with the overwhelming percentage caused by human activity[10] and accounted for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed [[greenhouse gas]]es, according to the 2021 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.[11]

Methane has also been detected on other planets, including [[Mars]], which has implications for [[astrobiology]] research.[12]
