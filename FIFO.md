FIFO stands for first in, first out, an easy-to-understand [[inventory]] valuation method that assumes that [[good]]s [[purchase]]d or [[produce]]d first are sold first. In theory, this means the oldest inventory gets [[ship]]ped out to customers before newer inventory.

In [[comput]]ing and in [[systems theory]], FIFO is an acronym for first in, first out (the first in is the first out), a method for organizing the manipulation of a [[data structure]] (often, specifically a [[data buffer]]) where the oldest (first) entry, or "head" of the queue, is processed first.
