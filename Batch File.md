A batch file is a script file in DOS, OS/2 and [[Microsoft]] [[Windows]]. It consists of a series of commands to be executed by the [[CLI]] command-line interpreter, stored in a plain [[text file]]. A batch file may contain any command the [[interpret]]er accepts interactively and use constructs that enable conditional [[branching]] and [[looping]] within the batch file, such as [[IF]], [[FOR]], and [[GOTO]] labels.
