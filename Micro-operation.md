#Computer  
In computer central processing units [[CPU]], micro-[[operation]]s (also known as micro-ops or Î¼ops, historically also as micro-actions[2]) are detailed low-level instructions used in some designs to implement complex machine instructions (sometimes termed macro-instructions in this context).

Usually, micro-operations perform basic operations on [[data]] stored in one or more [[register]]s, including transferring data between registers or between registers and external [[bus (comp)]]es of the central processing unit (CPU), and performing [[arithmetic]] or [[logic]]al operations on registers. In a typical [[fetch-decode-execute cycle]], each step of a macro-instruction is decomposed during its execution so the CPU determines and steps through a series of micro-operations. The execution of micro-operations is performed under control of the CPU's control unit, which decides on their execution while performing various optimizations such as reordering, fusion and [[cach]]ing
