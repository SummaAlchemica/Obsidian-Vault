A multicellular [[organism]] is an organism that consists of more than one cell, in contrast to [[unicellular]] organism.[1] All species of animals, land plants and most [[fungi]] are multicellular, as are many [[algae]], whereas a few organisms are partially uni- and partially multicellular, like [[slime mold]]s and social [[amoebae]] such as the [[genus]] [[Dictyostelium]].[2][3]

Multicellular organisms arise in various ways, for example by cell division or by aggregation of many single cells.[4][3] Colonial organisms are the result of many identical individuals joining together to form a [[colony]]. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial [[protist]]s from true multicellular organisms, because the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed "[[pluricellular]]" rather than "multicellular".[5][6] There are also [[macroscopic]] organisms that are [[multinucleate]] though technically unicellular, such as the [[Xenophyophorea]] that can reach 20 cm.
