#Economics 
A tax is a compulsory [[financial]] charge or some other type of levy imposed on a [[taxpayer]] (an [[individual]] or [[legal]] entity) by a [[government]]al organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures ([[regional]], [[local]], or [[national]]),[2] and tax compliance refers to [[policy]] actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct [[tax allowance]]s and [[tax relief]]s.[3] The first known taxation took place in [[Ancient Egypt]] around 3000â€“2800 BC.[4] Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in [[money]] or as its [[labor]] equivalent.

Most countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common societal, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government. Some levy a [[flat percentage rate]] of taxation on personal annual [[income]], but most scale taxes are progressive based on [[bracket]]s of annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on [[corporate]] income. Countries or subunits often also impose [[wealth]] taxes, [[inheritance]] taxes, [[estate]] taxes, [[gift]] taxes, [[property]] taxes, [[sale]]s taxes, [[use]] taxes, [[payroll]] taxes, duties and/or [[tariff]]s.

In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects on [[economic growth]] and economic welfare that can be both increased (known as fiscal multiplier) or decreased (known as excess burden of taxation). Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic by some, as although taxation is deemed necessary by general consensus in order for [[society]] to function and grow in an orderly and [[equitable]] manner through the government provision of public goods and public services,[5][6][7][8] others such as [[libertarian]]s and [[anarcho-capitalist]]s are [[anti-taxation]] and denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety, classifying taxation as [[theft]] or [[extortion]] through [[coercion]] along with the use of [[force]].
