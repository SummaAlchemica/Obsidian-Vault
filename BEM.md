BEM stands for Block Element Modifer.  It is a [[design]] methodology that helps in creating [[reusable component]]s and code sharing in [[front-end]] development. It is a [[system]] of [[method]]s that help in writing [[HTML]] and [[CSS]] code so it's easy to reuse and even share with other parts of code.
