MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in [[software]] design commonly used to implement user [[interface]]s, [[data]], and controlling [[logic]]. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.
