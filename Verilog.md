#Computer 
Verilog, standardized as IEEE 1364, is a hardware description language ([[HDL]]) used to model [[electronic]] [[system]]s. It is most commonly used in the design and verification of [[digital circuit]]s at the [[register]]-transfer level of [[abstract]]ion. It is also used in the verification of [[analog]] circuits and [[mixed-signal circuit]]s, as well as in the design of [[genetic circuit]]s. In 2009, the Verilog standard (IEEE 1364-2005) was merged into the SystemVerilog standard, creating IEEE Standard 1800-2009. Since then, Verilog is officially part of the SystemVerilog [[language]]. The current version is IEEE standard 1800-2017.[2]
