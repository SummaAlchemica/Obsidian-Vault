Genetics is the study of [[gene]]s, genetic variation, and [[heredity]] in organisms. It is an important branch in [[biolog]]y because heredity is vital to [[Organism]]s' [[evolution]]. Gregor [[Mendel]], a Moravian Augustinian friar working in the 19th century in Brno, was the first to study genetics scientifically.
