#Art 
Art is a diverse range of [[human]] activity, and resulting product, that involves [[creativ]] or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, [[beauty]], [[emotion]]al power, or conceptual ideas. There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout [[history]] and across [[culture]]s. In the Western tradition, the three [[classical]] branches of visual art are [[paint]]ing, [[sculpture]], and [[architecture]].[7] [[Theatre]], [[dance]], and other [[performing arts]], as well as [[literature]], [[music]], [[film]] and other media such as interactive [[media]], are included in a broader definition of the arts.[1][8] Until the 17th century, art referred to any [[skill]] or mastery and was not differentiated from[[ craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where [[aesthetic]] considerations are paramount, the [[fine art]]s are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the [[decorative]] or applied arts.

The nature of art and related concepts, such as [[creativity]] and interpretation, are explored in a branch of [[philosophy]] known as aesthetics.[9] The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.
