#Philosophy 
Analysis (pl: analyses) is the process of breaking a [[complex]] topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better [[understand]]ing of it. The technique has been applied in the study of [[math]]ematics and [[logic]] since before [[Aristotle]] (384–322 B.C.), though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.[1]

The word comes from the [[Ancient]] [[Greek]] ἀνάλυσις (analysis, "a breaking-up" or "an untying;" from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening").[2] From it also comes the word's plural, analyses.

As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to [[Alhazen]],[3] René [[Descartes]] (Discourse on the Method), and [[Galileo]] Galilei. It has also been ascribed to [[Isaac Newton]], in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name).

The converse of analysis is synthesis: putting the pieces back together again in a new or different whole.
