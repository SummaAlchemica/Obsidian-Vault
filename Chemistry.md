#Chemistry Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of [[matter]].[1] It is a physical science under natural sciences that covers the [[Element]] that make up matter to the [[compounds]] made of [[Atom]]s [[Molecule]]s and [[ion]]s: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a [[Chemical Reaction]] with other substances.[2][3][4][5] Chemistry also addresses the nature of [[chemical bonds]] in chemical compounds.

In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between [[Physic]] and [[biolog]]y.[6] It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.[7] For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth ([[botany]]), the formation of igneous rocks ([[geology]]), how [[atmospheric]] ozone is formed and how [[environment]]al pollutants are degraded ([[ecology]]), the properties of the [[soil]] on the moon ([[cosmochemistry]]), how medications work ([[Pharmacology]]), and how to collect [[DNA]] evidence at a crime scene (forensics)
