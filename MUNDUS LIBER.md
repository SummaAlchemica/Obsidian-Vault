	Dating and women
		Dating is a competitive game, but women are sore losers. Make them feel like they won but never let them win. You can only win if they're willing to play with you. They'll only play if they think they can win AND it's worth it to win. Don't play losing positions unless it's funny. Play poker. Be scary. Be busy, have a life, don't take it seriously. You will lose often, it's part of the game. Watch the trendline as you improve. Don't play losing hands, never chase, never simp (Don't get friendzoned). 
		women won't tolerate anything less than abuse
		quiet/shy girls are best to date
		hypergamy doesn't care
		18-25yr olds get left behind in dating
		women dont love you, only how you make them feel
		18-25yr old women don't want to settle, only have fun
		don't be swayed by any women
		better to be feared than loved
		train with operative conditioning
		you can't save them
		disgust fixes lust
		the bill always comes due
		once they get the ick it's over
		never get married
		they'll hate you if you take them back after they leave
		never show your feelings
		all women are like that
		be big, strong, handsome, wealthy, socialite, competent, unobtainable
		she must be (shorter,younger) than me, not(fat, ugly, a mom, boring, crazy, greedy, cagey, slutty/whorish, aggressive)

				    - Start by learning the fundamentals of the language - syntax, data types, functions, classes, etc. Work through beginner tutorials and books to get a solid base.
					- When you need to implement common data structures or algorithms, first look for existing implementations in the C++ standard library or other reputable libraries like Boost. Study those instead of creating your own versions.
					- Get familiar with common design patterns used in C++ like RAII, rule of three/five/zero, pimpl, etc. Applying these patterns will save you time compared to figuring them out yourself.
					- Learn about tools and utilities that come with C++ compilers and IDEs. Things like debuggers, profilers, static code analyzers can simplify many tasks for you.
					- Browse open source C++ projects on GitHub and study how experienced developers structure and architect their code. Look for patterns and idioms you can apply in your own code.
					- Learn the best practices for writing maintainable and extendable C++ code. Things like using const, minimizing dependencies, separating interface from implementation, etc.
					- When you need a new library or tool, first search repositories and documentation to see if something suitable already exists. Only write original code when absolutely needed.
					- Participate in C++ online forums and communities to learn from more experienced C++ developers. See how they solve problems while avoiding pitfalls.
