A flood [[myth]] or a deluge myth is a myth in which a great flood, usually sent by a [[deity]] or deities, destroys [[civiliz]]ation, often in an act of [[divin]]e retribution. Parallels are often drawn between the flood waters of these myths and the primaeval waters which appear in certain creation myths, as the flood waters are described as a measure for the cleansing of humanity, in preparation for rebirth.
