Truth is the property of being in accord with fact or reality. In everyday language, truth is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality or otherwise correspond to it, such as [[belief]]s, [[proposition]]s, and [[declarative]] [[sentence]]s. Truth is usually held to be the opposite of falsehood.
See also [[TRUE]].
