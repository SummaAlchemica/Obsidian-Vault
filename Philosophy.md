#Philosophy 
Philosophy is the systematized study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about [[existence]], [[reason]], [[knowledge]], [[values]],[[mind]], and [[language]]. Some sources claim the term was coined by [[Pythagoras]], although this theory is disputed by some. Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.[13][14][i]

Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher.[15] "Natural philosophy", which began as a discipline in ancient [[India]] and [[Ancient]] [[Greece]], encompasses [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], and [[Physic]].[16][17] For example, Isaac Newton's 1687 [[Math]]ematical [[Principle]]s of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize.[18][19] Since then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, and namely the [[social science]]s such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistic]]s, and [[economic]]s.

Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include [[metaphysics]], which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; [[epistemology]], which studies the nature of knowledge and [[belief]]; [[ethics]], which is concerned with [[moral]] value; and [[logic]], which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premises.[20][21] Other notable subfields include philosophy of [[religion]], philosophy of [[science]], [[politic]]al philosophy, [[aesthetic]]s, philosophy of language, and philosophy of [[mind]].
