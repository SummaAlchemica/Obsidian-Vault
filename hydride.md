#Chemistry 
In chemistry, a hydride is formally the [[anion]] of [[hydrogen]] (Hâˆ’).[1] The term is applied loosely. At one extreme, all compounds containing [[covalent]]ly bound H [[atom]]s are called hydrides: [[water]] (H2O) is a hydride of [[oxygen]], [[ammonia]] is a hydride of [[nitrogen]], etc. For [[inorganic]] chemists, hydrides refer to compounds and [[ions]] in which hydrogen is covalently attached to a less [[electronegative]] element. In such cases, the H centre has [[nucleophilic]] character, which contrasts with the [[protic]] character of [[acid]]s. The hydride [[anion]] is very rarely observed.

Almost all of the [[element]]s form b[[inary compound]]s with hydrogen, the exceptions being [[Helium]],[2] [[Neon]],[3] [[Argon]],[4] [[Krypton]],[5] [[Promethium]], [[Osmium]], [[Iridium]], [[Radon]], [[Francium]], and [[Radium]].[6][7][8][9] Exotic molecules such as [[positronium hydride]] have also been made.
