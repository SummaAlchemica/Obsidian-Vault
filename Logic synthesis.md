#Computer 
In [[computer engineering]], [[logic]] synthesis is a process by which an [[abstract]] specification of desired [[circuit]] behavior, typically at register transfer level ([[RTL]]), is turned into a design implementation in terms of logic gates, typically by a computer program called a synthesis tool. Common examples of this process include synthesis of designs specified in hardware description languages, including [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]].[1] Some synthesis tools generate [[bitstream]]s for programmable logic devices ([[PLU]]) such as [[PAL]]s or [[FPGA]]s, while others target the creation of [[ASIC]]s. Logic synthesis is one step in circuit design in the [[electronic design automation]], the others are place and route and verification and validation.
