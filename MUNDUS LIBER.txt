		question
		opinion undefended
		not entertaining
		technical jargon
		long winded, cart before horse, no hook
		too context dependent, no wide appeal
		dumb opinion, ideologically based, not logical
		Useless opinion, leads nowhere, no outputs
		Not based, too spoonfed
		Divisive, trolling

	Dating and women
		Wait an hour to respond to texts.
		Love is war 
		Bitches ain't shit
		rejection is a part of life
		don't be friends first
		never chase, never simp
		women won't tolerate anything less than abuse
		quiet/shy girls are best to date
		hypergamy doesn't care
		18-25yr olds get left behind in dating
		women dont love you, only how you make them feel
		18-25yr old women don't want to settle, only have fun
		don't be swayed by any women
		better to be feared than loved
		train with operative conditioning
		you can't save them
		disgust fixes lust
		the bill always comes due
		once they get the ick it's over
		never get married
		they'll hate you if you take them back after they leave
		never show your feelings
		all women are like that
		be big, strong, handsome, wealthy, socialite, competent, unobtainable
		she must be (shorter,younger) than me, not(fat, ugly, a mom, boring, crazy, greedy, cagey, slutty/whorish, aggressive)

		MIND: do as you will. [[model]], don't [[moral]]ize. survive and reproduce. [[Life]] is an infinite game. I am. nothing is new, all is [[cyclic]]al and [[symmetr]]ic. failure is [[feedback]], never struggle, let go, you're always here and now, all is within. use your whole being. only act to improve. rest>play>work>think>speak>consume. be a polymath. try everything once. 
		PEOPLE: people are selfish. groups and specialization are advantageous. keep a small circle, know your value. [[network]] is [[net worth]]. always remain neutral, no allies, no enemies. be smart, strong, kind. halo effect, be stoic, not a loser. flirt lots, sex little. don't shit where you eat, or fuck where you work. wear a condom.

		House design
			Efficient floor plan: optimal room size/no wastage
			Sustainable: low maintenance cost
			Good finishes: minimize biggest cost
			Simple design: squared designs are cheaper
			Open floor: more daylight and socializing 
			Multipurpose: Saves space
			Stock plans: editing is cheaper than from scratch
			Scale down: how much do you really need?
			Climate: Do you need a basement/garage in the tropics
			Minor variations
			No time overruns
			No shortcuts
			Good connections with subcontractors
			Attention to detail means low maintenance later
			Splurge where most visible
			Recycled materials, 2nd hand, shipping containers, stabilized earth blocks, structurally insulated panels
