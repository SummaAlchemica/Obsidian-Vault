#Chemistry 
Testosterone is the primary [[male]] [[sex]] [[hormone]] and [[anabolic]] [[steroid]] in [[male]]s.[3] In [[human]]s, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as [[testes]] and [[prostate]], as well as promoting [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s such as increased [[muscle]] and [[bone]] mass, and the growth of body [[hair]]. It is associated with increased aggression, violence, and criminal behavior, sex drive, the inclination to impress partners and other courting behaviors.[5] In addition, testosterone in both sexes is involved in health and well-being, where it has a significant effect on overall mood, cognition, social and sexual behaviour, [[metabol]]ism and [[energy]] output, the [[cardiovascular]] system, and in the prevention of osteoporosis.[6][7] Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty, accumulation of adipose fat tissue within the body, anxiety and depression, sexual performance issues, and bone loss.

Excessive levels of testosterone in men may be associated with hyperandrogenism, higher risk of heart failure, increased mortality in men with prostate cancer,[8] male pattern baldness, criminality, impulsivity, and hypersexuality.

Testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a ketone and a hydroxyl group at positions three and seventeen respectively. It is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites.[9] It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor.[9] In humans and most other vertebrates, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females. On average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about seven to eight times as great as in adult females.[10] As the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men.[11][12] Females are also more sensitive to the hormone.[13][page needed]

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, testosterone is used as a medication to treat hypogonadism, breast cancer, and gender dysphoria.[14] Since testosterone levels decrease as men age, testosterone is sometimes used in older men to counteract this deficiency. It is also used illicitly to enhance physique and performance, for instance in athletes.[15] The World Anti-Doping Agency lists it as S1 Anabolic agent substance "prohibited at all times".[16]

**Biosynthesis**
Like other steroid hormones, testosterone is derived from [[cholesterol]] (see figure).[151] The first step in the biosynthesis involves the oxidative cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol by cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 oxidase with the loss of six carbon atoms to give pregnenolone. In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield a variety of C19 steroids.[152] In addition, the 3β-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to produce androstenedione. In the final and rate limiting step, the C17 keto group androstenedione is reduced by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield testosterone.

The largest amounts of testosterone (>95%) are produced by the testes in men,[5] while the adrenal glands account for most of the remainder. Testosterone is also synthesized in far smaller total quantities in women by the adrenal glands, thecal cells of the ovaries, and, during pregnancy, by the placenta.[153] In the testes, testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells.[154] The male generative glands also contain Sertoli cells, which require testosterone for spermatogenesis. Like most hormones, testosterone is supplied to target tissues in the blood where much of it is transported bound to a specific plasma protein, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).
