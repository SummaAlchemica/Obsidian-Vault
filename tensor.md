- [[Scalar]] - a single [[quantity]] with no direction
    - Example: My house is 50 km from here
    - Physics: 50 km
    - Tensor of rank 0
- [[Vector]] - a [[magnitude]] and [[direction]]
    - Example: My house is 50 km NNE from here
    - Physics symbol example: x⃗ �→
    - Tensor of rank 1
- Tensor - a magnitude with a "stress" associated with it
    - Example: My house has a moment of inertia of Iij for i = x,y,z and j=x,y,z (see matrix below)
    - Physics symbol example: x↔�↔ (note that there are many different expressions for tensor, the authors prefer the double arrow)
    - Tensor of rank 2 or above (yes, engineers do use tensors but in general not until junior or senior year; engineers generally only go to rank 2 but scientists go higher)

For tensors of rank 1 and higher a matrix (or vector if you wish) can be used to express them. The matrix expression gets more complicated for rank 3 and 4 and will not be discussed herein (but you can research on your own if you like).
