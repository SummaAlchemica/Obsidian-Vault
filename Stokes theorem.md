In vector calculus and differential geometry the generalized Stokes theorem, also called the Stokesâ€“Cartan theorem, is a statement about the [[integra]]tion of differential forms on [[manifold]]s, which both simplifies and generalizes several theorems from [[vector calculus]]. The classical theorem of Stokes can be stated in one sentence: The [[line integral]] of a [[vector field]] over a [[loop]] is equal to the [[flux]] of its curl through the enclosed surface.
