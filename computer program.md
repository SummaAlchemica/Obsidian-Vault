#Computer 
A computer program is a sequence or set of instructions in a [[programming language]] for a [[Comput]] to execute. Computer programs are one component of [[software]], which also includes [[Software Documentation]] and other intangible components.[1]

A computer program in its human-readable form is called [[source code]]. Source code needs another computer program to execute because computers can only execute their native machine instructions. Therefore, source code may be translated to machine instructions using the language's [[compile]]r. (Assembly language programs are translated using an [[assembler]].) The resulting file is called an [[executable]]. Alternatively, source code may execute within the language's [[interpret]].[2]

If the executable is requested for execution, then the operating system loads it into [[memory]] and starts a [[process]].[3] The [[CPU (central processing unit)]] will soon switch to this process so it can fetch, decode, and then execute each machine instruction.[4]

If the source code is requested for execution, then the operating system loads the corresponding interpreter into memory and starts a process. The interpreter then loads the source code into memory to translate and execute each statement.[2] Running the source code is slower than running an executable.[a] Moreover, the interpreter must be installed on the computer.
