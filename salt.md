#Chemistry 
In [[chemistry]], a salt is a [[chemical]] compound consisting of an [[ion]]ic assembly of positively charged [[cation]]s and negatively charged [[anion]]s, which results in a compound with no net [[electric]] [[charge]].[1] A common example is table salt, with positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged [[chloride]] ions.

The component ions in a salt compound can be either [[inorganic]], such as chloride (Cl−), or organic, such as [[acetate]] (CH
3COO−
). Each ion can be either [[monatomic]], such as [[fluoride]] (F−), or [[polyatomic]], such as [[sulfate]] (SO2−
4).
