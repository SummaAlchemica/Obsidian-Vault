#Statistics 
In [[statistic]]s, Continuous [[probability]] distribution: A probability [[distribution]] in which the random [[variable]] X can take on any value (is continuous). Because there are infinite values that X could assume, the probability of X taking on any one specific value is zero. Therefore we often speak in ranges of values (p(X>0) = . 50). The [[normal distribution]] is one example of a continuous distribution. The probability that X falls between two values (a and b) equals the [[integral]] (area under the curve) from a to b:
