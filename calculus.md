#Math 
Calculus is the mathematical study of [[continuous]] [[change]], in the same way that [[geometry]] is the study of [[shape]], and [[algebra]] is the study of generalizations of [[arithmetic]] [[operation]]s.

It has two major branches, [[differential calculus]] and [[integral calculus]]; the former concerns [[instant]]aneous rates of change, and the [[slope]]s of [[curve]]s, while the latter concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], and they make use of the fundamental notions of [[convergence]] of [[infinite sequence]]s and [[infinite series]] to a well-defined limit.[1]

Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].[2][3] Later work, including codifying the idea of limits, put these developments on a more solid conceptual footing. Today, calculus has widespread uses in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[social science]].[4]
