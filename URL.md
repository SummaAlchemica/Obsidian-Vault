A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a [[web address]],[1] is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a [[Comput]] [[network]] and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),[2][3] although many people use the two terms interchangeably.[4][a] URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages ([[HTTP]]/[[HTTPS]]) but are also used for file transfer ([[FTP]]), [[email]] ([[mailto]]), [[database]] access ([[JDBC]]), and many other applications.

Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar. A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a [[protocol]] (http), a [[hostname]] (www.example.com), and a [[file]] name ([[index]].html).
