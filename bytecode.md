#Computer 
Bytecode is [[Comput]] [[object]] [[code]] that an [[interpret]] converts into [[binary]] [[machine code]] so it can be read by a computer's [[hardware]] [[processor]]. The interpreter is typically implemented as a [[virtual machine]] (VM) that translates the bytecode for the target platform.
