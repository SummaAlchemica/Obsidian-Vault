#Engineering 
Electronics is a scientific and [[engineering]] discipline that studies and applies the principles of [[Physic]] to [[design]], create, and operate devices that manipulate [[electron]]s and other charged [[particle]]s. Electronics is a subfield of [[electrical engineering]], but it differs from it in that it focuses on using active devices such as [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s, and [[integrated circuit]]s to control and [[amplif]]y the flow of electric [[current]] and to convert it from one form to another, such as from [[alternating current]] (AC) to [[direct current]] (DC) or from [[analog]] to [[digital]].[1] Electronics also encompasses the fields of [[microelectronics]], [[nanoelectronic]], [[optoelectronic]]s, and [[quantum electronic]]s, which deal with the fabrication and application of electronic devices at [[microscop]]ic, [[nanoscop]]ic, [[optical]], and [[quantum scales]].

Electronics has a profound impact on various aspects of modern [[society]] and [[culture]], such as [[communication]], [[entertainment]], [[education]], [[health care]], [[industry]], and [[security]]. The main driving force behind the advancement of electronics is the [[semiconductor]] industry, which produces the basic materials and components for electronic devices and [[circuit]]s. The semiconductor industry is one of the largest and most profitable sectors in the global economy, with annual revenues exceeding $481 [[billion]] in 2018. The electronics industry also encompasses other sectors that rely on electronic devices and systems, such as [[e-commerce]], which generated over $29 trillion in [[online]] [[sale]]s in 2017.
