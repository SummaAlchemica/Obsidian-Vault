#Math 
An integer is the [[number]] zero (0), a [[positiv]]e natural number (1, 2, 3, etc.) or a negative integer with a minus sign (−1, −2, −3, etc.).[1] The negative numbers are the additive inverses of the corresponding positive numbers.[2] In the language of mathematics, the set of integers is often denoted by the boldface Z or blackboard bold 
The set of natural numbers 
N  is a subset of 
Z, which in turn is a subset of the set of all rational numbers 
Q , itself a subset of the real numbers 
R . Like the natural numbers, 
Z  is countably infinite. An integer may be regarded as a real number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9.75, 5+
1/2, and √2 are not.

The integers form the smallest group and the smallest ring containing the natural numbers. In [[algebra]]ic [[number theory]], the integers are sometimes qualified as [[rational]] integers to distinguish them from the more general algebraic integers. In fact, (rational) integers are algebraic integers that are also rational numbers.
