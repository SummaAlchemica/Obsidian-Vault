Existentialism (/ˌɛɡzɪˈstɛnʃəlɪzəm/ [1] /ˌɛksəˈstɛntʃəˌlɪzəm/)[2] is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores the issue of [[human]] existence.[3][4] Existentialist philosophers explore questions related to the [[meaning]], [[purpose]], and [[value]] of human existence. Common concepts in existentialist thought include existential [[crisis]], [[dread]], and [[anxiety]] in the face of an [[absurd]] world, as well as [[authentic]]ity, [[courage]], and virtue.[5]

Existentialism is associated with several 19th- and 20th-century [[Europe]]an philosophers who shared an emphasis on the human subject, despite often profound differences in thought.[6][4][7] Among the earliest figures associated with existentialism are philosophers Søren [[Kierkegaard]] and Friedrich [[Nietzsche]] and novelist Fyodor [[Dostoevsky]], all of whom critiqued [[rational]]ism and concerned themselves with the problem of meaning. In the 20th century, prominent existentialist thinkers included Jean-Paul [[Sartre]], Albert [[Camus]], Martin [[Heidegger]], Simone de [[Beauvoir]], Karl [[Jaspers]], Gabriel [[Marcel]], and Paul Tillich.

Many existentialists considered traditional systematic or [[academic]] philosophies, in style and content, to be too [[abstract]] and removed from [[concrete]] human experience.[8][9] A primary virtue in existentialist thought is authenticity.[10] Existentialism would influence many disciplines outside of philosophy, including [[theology]], [[drama]], [[art]], [[literature]], and [[psychology]].[11]

Existentialist philosophy encompasses a range of perspectives, but it shares certain underlying concepts. Among these, a central [[tenet]] of existentialism is that personal [[freedom]], individual [[responsibility]], and deliberate [[choice]] are essential to the pursuit of self-discovery and the determination of life's meaning.[12]
