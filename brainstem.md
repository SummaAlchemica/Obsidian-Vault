The brainstem (or [[brain]] stem) is the posterior stalk-like part of the brain that connects the [[cerebrum]] with the [[spinal cord]].[1] In the [[human]] brain the brainstem is composed of the [[midbrain]], the [[pons]], and the [[medulla oblongata]]. The midbrain is continuous with the [[thalamus]] of the [[diencephalon]] through the [[tentorial notch]],[2]: 152  and sometimes the diencephalon is included in the brainstem.

The brainstem is very small, making up around only 2.6 percent of the brain's total weight.[2]: 195  It has the critical roles of regulating [[cardiac]], and [[respiratory]] function, helping to control [[heart]] rate and breathing rate.[3] It also provides the main [[motor (nerve)]] and [[sensory (nerve)]] [[nerve]] supply to the [[face]] and [[neck]] via the [[cranial nerve]]s. Ten pairs of cranial nerves come from the brainstem.[4] Other roles include the regulation of the [[central nervous system]] and the body's sleep cycle.[3] It is also of prime importance in the conveyance of motor and sensory pathways from the rest of the brain to the body, and from the body back to the brain.[3] These pathways include the [[corticospinal]] tract (motor function), the [[dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway]] (fine touch, vibration [[sensation]], and [[proprioception]]), and the [[spinothalamic tract]] ([[pain]], [[temperature]], [[itch]], and crude touch).[5]
