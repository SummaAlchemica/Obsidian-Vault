#Math 
In [[math]]ematics, sine and [[cosine]] are [[trigonometr]]ic [[function]]s of an [[angle]]. The sine and cosine of an [[acute]] angle are defined in the context of a [[right triangle]]: for the specified angle, its sine is the [[ratio]] of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the [[hypotenuse]]), and the cosine is the ratio of the length of the [[adjacent]] leg to that of the hypotenuse. For an angle 
�\theta , the sine and cosine functions are denoted simply as 
sin
⁡
�\sin \theta  and 
cos
⁡
�\cos \theta.[1]

More generally, the definitions of sine and cosine can be extended to any real value in terms of the lengths of certain line segments in a unit circle. More modern definitions express the sine and cosine as infinite series, or as the solutions of certain differential equations, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to complex numbers.

The sine and cosine functions are commonly used to model periodic phenomena such as sound and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations throughout the year. They can be traced to the jyā and koṭi-jyā functions used in Indian astronomy during the Gupta period.
