#Chemistry 
In chemistry, many authors consider an organic compound to be any [[chemical]] [[compound]] that contains [[carbon]]-[[hydrogen]] or carbon-carbon [[bond]]s, although the definition of "organic" versus "[[inorganic]]" varies from author to author, and is a topic of debate. For example, [[methane]] (CH4) is considered organic, but whether some other carbon-containing compounds are organic or inorganic varies from author to author, like halides of carbon without carbon-hydrogen bonds (e.g. carbon [[tetrachloride]] CCl4), as well as certain compounds of carbon with [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] (e.g. [[cyanide]] [[ion]] CN− and [[carbonate]] ion CO

, which are generally considered inorganic).

Due to carbon's ability to [[catenate]] (form chains with other carbon [[atom]]s), millions of organic compounds are known. The study of the properties, [[reaction]]s, and syntheses of organic compounds comprise the discipline known as [[organic chemistry]]. For historical reasons, a few classes of carbon-containing compounds (e.g., [[carbonate salt]]s and [[cyanide salt]]s), along with a few other exceptions (e.g., [[carbon dioxide]], and even [[hydrogen cyanide]] despite the fact it contains a carbon-hydrogen bond), are generally not classified as organic compounds and are generally considered inorganic. Other than those just named, little consensus exists among chemists on precisely which carbon-containing compounds are excluded, making any rigorous definition of an organic compound elusive.[1]

Although organic compounds make up only a small percentage of Earth's crust, they are of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds. Living things incorporate inorganic carbon compounds into organic compounds through a network of processes (the [[carbon cycle]]) that begins with the conversion of carbon dioxide and a hydrogen source like water into simple [[sugar]]s and other organic molecules by [[autotrophic]] [[organism]]s using [[light]] ([[photosynthesis]]) or other sources of energy. Most synthetically-produced organic compounds are ultimately derived from [[petrochemical]]s consisting mainly of [[hydrocarbon]]s, which are themselves formed from the high pressure and temperature degradation of organic matter underground over geological timescales.[2] This ultimate derivation notwithstanding, organic compounds are no longer defined as compounds originating in living things, as they were historically.

In chemical nomenclature, an [[organyl]] group, frequently represented by the letter R, refers to any [[monovalent]] substituent whose open [[valence]] is on a carbon atom.[3]
