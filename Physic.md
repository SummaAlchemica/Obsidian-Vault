#Physics
Physics is the natural [[science]] of [[matter]], involving the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its [[motion]] and behavior through [[space]] and [[time]], and the related entities of [[energy]] and [[force]]. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the [[universe]] behaves.[b][3][4][5] A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.

Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of [[astronomy]], perhaps the oldest.[6] Over much of the past two millennia, physics, [[chemistry]], [[biolog]]y, and certain branches of [[math]]ematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.[c] Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences[3] and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and [[philosophy]].

Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of [[electromagnetism]], [[solid-state physics]], and [[nuclear physics]] led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as [[television]], [[Comput]]s, domestic appliances, and [[nuclear weapon]]s;[3] advances in [[thermodynamic]]s led to the development of [[industrial]]ization; and advances in [[mechanic]]s inspired the development of [[calculus]].
