Classics or classical studies is the study of classical [[antiquity]]. In the [[Western world]], classics [[tradition]]ally refers to the study of Classical [[Greek]] and [[Roman]] [[literature]] and their related original [[language]]s, Ancient Greek and Latin. Classics also includes Greco-Roman philosophy, history, archaeology, anthropology, art, mythology and society as secondary subjects.

In Western civilization, the study of the Greek and Roman classics was traditionally considered to be the foundation of the humanities, and has, therefore, traditionally been the cornerstone of a typical elite European [[education]].

Etymology
The word classics is derived from the Latin adjective classicus, meaning "belonging to the highest class of citizens." The word was originally used to describe the members of the [[Patrician]]s, the highest class in ancient [[Rome]]. By the 2nd century AD the word was used in literary criticism to describe writers of the highest quality.[1] For example, Aulus Gellius, in his Attic Nights, contrasts "classicus" and "proletarius" writers.[2] By the 6th century AD, the word had acquired a second meaning, referring to pupils at a school.[1] Thus, the two modern meanings of the word, referring both to literature considered to be of the highest quality, and to the standard [[text]]s used as part of a curriculum, both derive from Roman use.[1]
