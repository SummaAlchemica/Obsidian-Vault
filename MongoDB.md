MongoDB is a [[source-available]] [[cross-platform]] [[document-oriented]] [[database]] program. Classified as a [[NoSQL]] [[database]] program, MongoDB uses [[JSON]]-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License which is deemed non-free by several distributions.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database which stores data in [[BJSON]] (Binary JavaScript Object Notation).

MongoDB became the de facto standard database for [[Node.js ]]applications to fulfill the "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to transmit data across different tiers (front-end, back-end, and the database).
