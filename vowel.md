#Linguistics 
A vowel is a [[syllab]]ic [[speech]] [[sound]] pronounced without any [[stricture]] in the [[vocal tract]].[1] Vowels are one of the two principal classes of speech sounds, the other being the [[consonant]]. Vowels vary in quality, in loudness and also in quantity (length). They are usually voiced and are closely involved in [[prosodic]] variation such as [[tone]], [[intonation]] and [[stress]].

The word vowel comes from the [[Latin]] word vocalis, meaning "vocal" (i.e. relating to the voice).[2] In English, the word vowel is commonly used to refer both to vowel sounds and to the written symbols that represent them (a, e, i, o, u, and sometimes w and y).[3]
