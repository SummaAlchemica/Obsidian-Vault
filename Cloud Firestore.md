Cloud Firestore is a [[NoSQL]] document database that lets you easily store, sync, and query data for your mobile and [[web apps]] - at global scale.

Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and [[server]] development from Firebase and [[Google]] [[Cloud]]. Like Firebase Realtime [[Database]], it keeps your [[data]] in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build [[responsive]] apps that work regardless of [[network]] [[latency]] or [[Internet]] connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions.
