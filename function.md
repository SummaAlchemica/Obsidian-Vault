#Math 
In mathematics, a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y.[1] The set X is called the [[domain]] of the function[2] and the set Y is called the [[codomain]] of the function.[3][better source needed]

Functions were originally the [[ideal]]ization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. For example, the [[position]] of a [[planet]] is a function of [[time]]. Historically, the concept was elaborated with the [[infinitesimal calculus]] at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were [[differentiable]] (that is, they had a high degree of regularity). The concept of a function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of [[set theory]], and this greatly enlarged the domains of application of the concept.
