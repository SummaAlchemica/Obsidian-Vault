#Linguistics

In [[linguistic]]s, syntax (/ˈsɪntæks/)[1][2] is the study of how words and morphemes combine to form larger units such as phrases and [[sentence]]s. Central concerns of syntax include word order, grammatical relations, [[hierarchical sentence structure]] (constituency),[3] agreement, the nature of [[crosslinguistic variation]], and the relationship between form and meaning (semantics). There are numerous approaches to syntax that differ in their central assumptions and goals.

 In [[Linguistic]]s, [[Synta]] is _the arrangement or order of [[word]]s, determined by both the writer's style and [[grammar]] rules_

[[Synta]] in [[Comput]] [[programming]] means _the rules that control the structure of the [[symbols]], [[punctuation]], and words of a [[programming language_]].
