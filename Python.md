#Computer #Language Python is an interpreted, [[Object-oriented]], [[high-level programming language]] with [[dynamic semantics]]. Its high-level built in [[Data Structure]], combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn [[Synta]] emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports [[modules and packages]], which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python [[interpret]] and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

**Python** is an [[open source]] programming language, initially designed by the Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. The first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in 1991. It is **powerful, user-friendly and easy to learn**.

Python is used in many fields such as [[Machine Learning]] (ML), automation and scientific computing. It can also serve as a scripting language for web applications. Furthermore, there are diverse **Python [[framework]]s, like Django, TurboGears and Flask**, that support developers in the development of complex applications.
