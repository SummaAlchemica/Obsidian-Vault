#Computer #Language 

Structured query [[language]] (SQL) is a [[programming language]] for storing and processing information in a relational [[database]]. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. You can use SQL statements to store, update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance in [[Relational DataBase Management Systems]].
