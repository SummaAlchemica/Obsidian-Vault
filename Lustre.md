#Computer 
Lustre is a type of [[parallel distributed file system]], generally used for large-scale [[cluster computing]]. The name Lustre is a portmanteau word derived from [[Linux]] and [[cluster]].[6] Lustre file system [[software]] is available under the [[GNU]] General Public License (version 2 only) and provides high performance file systems for computer clusters ranging in size from small workgroup clusters to large-scale, multi-site systems. Since June 2005, Lustre has consistently been used by at least half of the top ten, and more than 60 of the top 100 fastest supercomputers in the world,[7][8][9] including the world's No. 1 ranked TOP500 supercomputer in November 2022, Frontier,[4] as well as previous top supercomputers such as [[Fugaku]],[10] [[Titan]][11] and [[Sequoia]].[12]

Lustre file systems are scalable and can be part of multiple computer clusters with tens of thousands of client nodes, tens of [[petabyte]]s (PB) of storage on hundreds of [[server]]s, and more than a [[terabyte]] per [[second]] (TB/s) of aggregate I/O [[throughput]].[13][14] This makes Lustre file systems a popular choice for businesses with large data centers, including those in industries such as [[meteorology]], [[simulation]],[15] [[oil]] and [[gas]], [[life science]], [[rich media]], and [[finance]].[16] The I/O performance of Lustre has widespread impact on these applications and has attracted broad attention.[17][18][19][20]
