In [[quantum]] computing, quantum finite automata (QFA) or quantum state machines are a quantum analog of [[probabilistic automata ]]or a [[Markov decision process]]. They provide a [[math]]ematical [[abstract]]ion of real-world quantum computers. Several types of automata may be defined, including measure-once and measure-many automata. Quantum finite automata can also be understood as the quantization of subshifts of finite type, or as a quantization of Markov chains. QFAs are, in turn, special cases of geometric finite automata or [[topolog]]ical finite automata.

The languages accepted by QFAs are not the regular languages of deterministic finite automata, nor are they the [[stochastic]] [[language]]s of probabilistic [[finite]] automata. Study of these quantum languages remains an active area of research.
