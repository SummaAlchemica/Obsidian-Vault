#History 
The Imperial [[Japan]]ese [[Navy]] (IJN; Kyūjitai: 大日本帝國海軍 Shinjitai: 大日本帝国海軍 Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kaigun (help·info) 'Navy of the Greater Japanese [[Empire]]', or 日本海軍 Nippon Kaigun, 'Japanese Navy') was the navy of the Empire of Japan from 1868 to 1945, when it was dissolved following Japan's surrender in [[World War II]]. The [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF) was formed between 1952 and 1954 after the dissolution of the IJN.[1]

The Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920, behind the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[United States Navy]] (USN).[2] It was supported by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for [[aircraft]] and [[airstrike]] operation from the [[fleet]]. It was the primary opponent of the [[Western Allies]] in the [[Pacific War]].

The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the [[Asian continent]], beginning in the [[early medieval period]] and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of cultural exchange with European powers during the [[Age of Discovery]]. After two centuries of stagnation during the country's ensuing seclusion [[policy]] under the [[shōgun]] of the [[Edo period]], Japan's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by American intervention in 1854. This eventually led to the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Accompanying the re-ascendance of the [[Emperor]] came a period of frantic [[modernization]] and [[industrialization]]. The navy had several successes, sometimes against much more powerful enemies such as in the [[Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], before being largely destroyed in World War II.
