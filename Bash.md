[[Bash]] is a [[Unix]] [[shell]] and command language written by Brian Fox for the [[GNU]] Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.[12][13] First released in 1989,[14] it has been used as the default login shell for most [[Linux]] distributions.[15] Bash was one of the first programs Linus Torvalds ported to Linux, alongside GCC.[16] A version is also available for Windows 10 and Windows 11 via the Windows Subsystem for Linux.[17][18] It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11.[19] Bash was also the default shell in versions of Apple [[macOS]] from 10.3 (originally, the default shell was tcsh) to 10.15 (macOS Catalina), which changed the default shell to zsh, although Bash remains available as an alternative shell.[20]

Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a [[shell script]]. Like most Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, [[variable]]s, and control structures for condition-testing and [[iteration]]. The keywords, [[Synta]], [[dynamic]]ally scoped variables and other basic features of the [[language]] are all copied from sh. Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.

The shell's name is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, a pun on the name of the Bourne shell that it replaces[21] and the notion of being "born again".[22][23]

A security hole in Bash dating from version 1.03 (August 1989),[24] dubbed Shellshock, was discovered in early September 2014 and quickly led to a range of attacks across the [[Internet]].[25][26][27] Patches to fix the bugs were made available soon after the bugs were identified.
