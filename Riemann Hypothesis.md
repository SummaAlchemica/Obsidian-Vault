In mathematics, the Riemann [[hypothesi]]s is the conjecture that the [[Riemann zeta function]] has its zeros only at the [[negative]] [[even]] [[integer]]s and [[complex number]]s with real part 1/2. Many consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in [[pure math]]ematics. It is of great interest in [[number theory]] because it implies results about the [[distribution]] of [[prime number]]s. It was proposed by Bernhard Riemann, after whom it is named. The Riemann hypothesis and some of its generalizations, along with Goldbach's conjecture and the twin prime conjecture, make up Hilbert's eighth problem in David Hilbert's list of twenty-three unsolved problems; it is also one of the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems, which offers a million dollars to anyone who solves any of them. The name is also used for some closely related [[analogue]]s, such as the Riemann hypothesis for [[curve]]s over [[finite]] [[field]]s.
