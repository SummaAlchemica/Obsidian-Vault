A rifle is a long-barreled [[firearm]] designed for accurate shooting, with a barrel that has a [[heli]]cal pattern of grooves cut into the bore wall. In keeping with their focus on [[accuracy]], rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter's shoulder via a [[buttstock]] for stability during shooting. Rifles are used extensively in warfare, [[law]] enforcement, [[hunt]]ing, shooting [[sport]]s, and [[crime]]. The term was originally rifled gun, with the verb rifle referring to the early modern machining process of creating groovings with cutting tools.
