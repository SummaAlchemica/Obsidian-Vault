#Computer 
A [[programming language]] is loosely typed, or weakly typed,Â **when it does not require the explicit specification of different types of objects and [[variable]]s**. The "looser" typing rules in weakly typed programming languages can produce erroneous or unpredictable results. It can execute implicit type conversions at [[runtime]].
