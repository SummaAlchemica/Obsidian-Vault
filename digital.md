Digital [[data]], in [[definition]] [[theory]] and [[definition]] [[system]]s, is information represented as a [[string]] of [[discrete]] [[symbol]]s, each of which can take on one of only a finite number of values from some [[alphabet]], such as [[letter]]s or [[digit]]s. An example is a [[text]] [[document]], which consists of a string of [[alphanumeric]] [[character (ling)]]s.
