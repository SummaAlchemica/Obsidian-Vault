#Engineering 
Nanoelectronics refers to the use of nanotechnology in [[electronic]] [[component]]s. The term covers a diverse set of devices and materials, with the common characteristic that they are so small that inter-[[atom]]ic interactions and [[quantum]] mechanical properties need to be studied extensively. Some of these candidates include: hybrid molecular/[[semiconductor]] electronics, one-dimensional [[nanotube]]s/[[nanowire]]s (e.g. [[silicon]] nanowires or [[carbon]] nanotubes) or advanced [[molecular electronic]]s.

Nanoelectronic devices have critical dimensions with a size range between 1 nm and 100 nm.[1] Recent silicon [[MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor)]] technology generations are already within this regime, including 22 nanometers CMOS (complementary MOS) nodes and succeeding 14 nm, 10 nm and 7 nm [[FinFET (fin field-effect transistor)]] generations. Nanoelectronics is sometimes considered as disruptive technology because present candidates are significantly different from traditional transistors.
