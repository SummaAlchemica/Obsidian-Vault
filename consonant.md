#Linguistics 
In [[articulat]]ory [[phonetic]]s, a consonant is a [[speech]] [[sound]] that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the [[vocal tract]]. Examples are [p] and [b], pronounced with the lips; [t] and [d], pronounced with the front of the [[tongue]]; [k] and [g], pronounced with the back of the tongue; [h], pronounced in the [[throat]]; [f], [v], and [s], pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel ([[fricative]]s); and [m] and [n], which have air flowing through the [[nose]] ([[nasal]]s). Contrasting with consonants are [[vowel]]s.

Since the number of speech sounds in the world's [[language]]s is much greater than the number of [[letter]]s in any one [[alphabet]], linguists have devised systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet ([[IPA]]) to assign a unique and unambiguous [[symbol]] to each attested consonant. The English alphabet has fewer consonant letters than the [[English]] language has consonant sounds, so digraphs like ⟨[[ch]]⟩, ⟨[[sh]]⟩, ⟨[[th]]⟩, and ⟨[[ng]]⟩ are used to extend the alphabet, though some letters and [[digraph]]s represent more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled ⟨th⟩ in "this" is a different consonant from the ⟨th⟩ sound in "thin". (In the IPA, these are [ð] and [θ], respectively.)
