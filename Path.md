#Computer 
A path is a [[string]] of [[character (ling)]]s used to uniquely identify a location in a [[directory structure]]. It is composed by following the [[directory tree hierarchy]] in which components, separated by a [[delimiting character]], represent each [[Directory (comp)]]. The delimiting character is most commonly the slash ("/"), the backslash character ("\"), or colon (":"), though some operating systems may use a different delimiter. Paths are used extensively in [[computer science]] to represent the [[directory/file relationship]]s common in modern operating systems and are essential in the construction of Uniform Resource Locators ([[URL]]s). Resources can be represented by either absolute or relative paths.
