#Philosophy 
A system is a group of [[interact]]ing or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole.[1] A system, surrounded and influenced by its [[environment]], is described by its boundaries, structure and purpose and is expressed in its [[function]]ing. Systems are the subjects of study of [[systems theory]] and other systems sciences.

Systems have several common properties and characteristics, including [[structure]], function(s), [[behavior]] and [[interconnect]]ivity.
