#Engineering 
Optoelectronics (or optronics) is the study and application of [[electronic]] devices and systems that find, detect and control light, [[usually]] considered a sub-field of [[photonic]]s. In this context, light often includes invisible forms of [[radiation]] such as [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]], in addition to [[visible light]]. Optoelectronic devices are [[electrical-to-optical]] or [[optical-to-electrical]] [[transducer]]s, or instruments that use such devices in their operation.[1]

Electro-optics is often erroneously used as a synonym, but is a wider branch of physics that concerns all interactions between [[light]] and [[electric field]]s, whether or not they form part of an electronic device.

Optoelectronics is based on the quantum mechanical effects of light on electronic materials, especially [[semiconductor]]s, sometimes in the presence of electric fields.[2]
