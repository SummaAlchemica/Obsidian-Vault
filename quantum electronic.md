#Engineering 
Quantum [[electronic]]s is a term that was used mainly between the 1950s and 1970s[6] to denote the area of [[Physic]] dealing with the effects of [[quantum]] mechanics on the behavior of [[electron]]s in [[matter]], together with their interactions with [[photon]]s. Today, it is rarely considered a sub-field in its own right, and it has been absorbed by other fields. [[Solid state physics]] regularly takes [[quantum mechanics]] into account, and is usually concerned with electrons. Specific applications of quantum mechanics in [[electronic]]s is researched within semiconductor physics. The term also encompassed the basic processes of [[laser]] operation, which is today studied as a topic in quantum optics. Usage of the term overlapped early work on the [[quantum Hall effect]] and [[quantum cellular automata]].
