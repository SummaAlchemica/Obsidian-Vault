#Law 
Sovereignty can generally be defined as supreme [[authority]].[1] Sovereignty entails [[hierarchy]] within the [[state]], as well as external [[autonomy]] for states.[2] In any state, sovereignty is assigned to the person, body, or [[institution]] that has the ultimate authority over other people in order to establish a [[law]] or change existing laws.[3] In [[political theory]], sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme legitimate authority over some polity.[4] In international law, sovereignty is the exercise of power by a state. De jure sovereignty refers to the legal right to do so; de facto sovereignty refers to the factual ability to do so. This can become an issue of special concern upon the failure of the usual expectation that de jure and de facto sovereignty exist at the place and time of concern, and reside within the same organization.
