[[Digital]] hoarding (also known as e-hoarding, e-clutter, [[data]] [[hoard]]ing, digital pack-rattery or cyber hoarding) is defined by researchers as an emerging sub-type of hoarding [[disorder]] characterized by individuals collecting excessive digital material which lead to those individuals experiencing stress and disorganization.[1] Digital hoarding takes place in [[electronic]] environments where information is stored digitally. The term gained popularity among online [[forum]]s and in the media before receiving scholarly attention.[2] [[Research]] indicates there may be correlation between individuals who exhibit physical and digital hoarding behaviors[3][4] and acknowledges there is a lack of [[psycholog]]ical [[literature]] on the subject.[5]

Several studies suggest the main influential factors of digital hoarding are related to a number of issues and personal reasons which includes reduced costs for storing data, individuals lacking time to [[curate]] accumulated data, the perceived lifespan of data and [[emotional attachment]] to digital assets. The studies conducted to examine digital hoarding are limited in scope as this is an emerging area of study. There is a lack of agreement among researchers about whether digital hoarding is a condition to be treated rather than a [[normal]] human activity.[6]
