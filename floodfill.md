Flood fill, also called seed fill, is a flooding [[algorithm]] that determines and alters the area connected to a given [[node]] in a [[multi-dimensional array]] with some matching attribute. It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and [[Minesweeper]] for determining which pieces are cleared. ![](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZMQbHMgK2rw?start=487)
