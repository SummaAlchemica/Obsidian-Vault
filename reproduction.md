Reproduction is the biological process by which new individual [[Organism]]s – "offspring" – are produced from their "[[parent]]" or parents. Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known [[life]]; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: [[asexual]] and [[sexual]]. Sexual reproduction involves [[intercourse]], and the combination of a [[gamete]] from each parent.
