#Engineering 
An axle or axletree is a central [[shaft]] for a rotating [[wheel]] or [[gear]]. On wheeled [[vehicle]]s, the axle may be fixed to the wheels, rotating with them, or fixed to the vehicle, with the wheels rotating around the axle. In the former case, [[bearing]]s or [[bushing]]s are provided at the [[mount]]ing points where the axle is supported.
