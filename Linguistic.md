#Linguistics
LInguistics is the scientific study of [[language]] and its structure, including the study of [[morphology]], [[Synta]]x, [[phonetic]], and [[semantics]]. Specific branches of linguistics include [[sociolinguistic]]s, [[dialectology]], [[psycholinguistic]]s, [[Computational Linguistics]], [[historical-comparative linguistics]], and [[applied linguistics]].


Linguistics is the scientific study of [[language]]. It entails the comprehensive, [[systematic]], [[objective]], and precise [[analysis]] of all aspects of [[language]] — [[cognitive]], [[social]], [[environment]]al, biological as well as structural.

Linguistics is considered to be an applied science as well as an academic field of general study within the humanities and social sciences. Traditional areas of [[linguistic analysis]] correspond to [[Synta]] (rules governing the structure of sentences), [[semantic]]s (meaning), [[morphology]] (structure of words), [[phonetic]]s ([[speech]] [[sound]]s and equivalent gestures in [[sign language]]s), [[phonology]] (the [[abstract]] [[sound]] system of a particular language), and [[pragmatic]]s (how social context contributes to meaning). Subdisciplines such as [[biolinguistic]]s (the study of the biological variables and evolution of language) and psycholinguistics (the study of psychological factors in human language) bridge many of these divisions.

Linguistics encompasses many branches and subfields that span both theoretical and practical applications. [[Theoretical linguistic]]s (including traditional descriptive linguistics) is concerned with understanding the universal and fundamental nature of language and developing a general theoretical framework for describing it. [[Applied linguistic]]s seeks to utilise the scientific findings of the study of language for practical purposes, such as developing methods of improving language [[education]] and [[literacy]].

Linguistic [[phenomena]] may be studied through a variety of perspectives: [[synchronical]]ly (by describing the shifts in a language at a certain specific point of time) or [[diachronical]]ly (ie, through the historical development of language over several periods of time), in [[monolingual]]s or in [[multilingual]]s, amongst children or amongst adults, in terms of how it is being learned or as in terms of how it was acquired, as [[abstract]] objects or as cognitive structures, through written texts or through [[oral]] elicitation, and finally through [[mechanic]]al [[data]] collection or through practical fieldwork.

Linguistics emerged from the field of [[philology]] and the both are now variably described as related fields, subdisciplines, or the latter to have been superseded by linguistics altogether.[11] Linguistics is also related to the philosophy of language, [[stylistic]]s, [[rhetoric]], [[semiotic]]s, [[lexicography]], and translation. ![[Linguistics for Dummies.pdf]]
