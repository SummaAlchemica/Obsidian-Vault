#Computer 
A command-line [[interface]] is a means of interacting with a [[device]] or [[Comput]] [[program]] with commands from a user or client, and responses from the device or [[program]], in the form of lines of [[text]]. Such access was first provided by [[computer terminal]]s starting in the mid-1960s.
