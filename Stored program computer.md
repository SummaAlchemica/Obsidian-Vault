#Computer 
A stored-program [[computer]] is a computer that stores [[program]] instructions in [[electronic]]ally or [[optic]]ally accessible [[memory]].[1] This contrasts with systems that stored the program instructions with [[plugboard]]s or similar mechanisms.

The definition is often extended with the requirement that the treatment of programs and data in memory be interchangeable or uniform.[2][3][4]
