#Computer [[Comput]] Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with [[software]] and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

Principal areas of study within Computer Science include [[artificial intelligence]], computer systems and [[network]], [[security]], [[database]] systems, human [[Comput]] interaction, vision and [graphics], [[numerical analysis]], [[programming language]]s, [[software engineering]], [[bioinformatics]] and [[theory]] of computing.

Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze [[Data Structure]] and [[Algorithm]] to solve programs and study the performance of [[computer hardware]] and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the [[abstract]]-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.
