Volvox is a [[polyphyletic]] [[genus]] of [[chlorophyte]] [[green]] [[algae]] in the [[family]] [[Volvocaceae]]. It forms [[spher]]ical colonies of up to 50,000 [[cell]]s. They live in a variety of [[freshwater]] [[habitat]]s, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700. Volvox diverged from [[unicellular]] [[ancestor]]s approximately 200 million years ago.

Description

Volvox colony: 1) Chlamydomonas-like cell, 2) Daughter colony, 3) [[Cytoplasm]]ic bridges, 4) Intercellular gel, 5) Reproductive cell, 6) Somatic cell.
Volvox is a polyphyletic genus in the [[volvocine]] green algae [[clade]]. Each mature Volvox colony is composed of up to thousands of cells from two [[differentiate]]d cell types: numerous [[flagellate]] [[somatic]] cells and a smaller number of germ cells lacking in soma that are embedded in the surface of a hollow [[sphere]] or [[coenobium]] containing an [[extracellular matrix]] made of [[glycoprotein]]s.

Adult somatic cells comprise a single layer with the flagella facing outward. The cells swim in a coordinated fashion, with distinct anterior and posterior poles. The cells have anterior [[eyespot]]s that enable the [[colony]] to swim toward [[light]]. The cells of colonies in the more [[basal]] [[Euvolvox]] clade are interconnected by thin strands of cytoplasm, called [[protoplasmate]]s. Cell number is specified during development and is dependent on the number of rounds of division.
