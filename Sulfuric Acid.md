Sulfuric [[acid]] is the most commonly-produced [[industrial]] [[chemical]] in the world. Its primary industrial use is to make [[phosphoric acid]] which is a main ingredient in most chemical [[fertilizers]]. Sulfuric acid is a critical component for [[metal]] [[manufacturing]], particularly in the production of [[copper]] and [[zinc]] as well as the cleaning of [[steel]]. Sulfuric acid output grows over 3% a year and is driven in large part by demand from the [[Asia-Pacific region]].
