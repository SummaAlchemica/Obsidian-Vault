Discrete [[math]]ematics is the study of [[mathematical structure]]s that can be considered "discrete" (in a way analogous to discrete [[variable]]s, having a [[bijection]] with the set of natural numbers) rather than "[[continuous]]" (analogously to [[continuous function]]s). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include [[integer]]s, graphs, and statements in [[logic]].[1][2][3] By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as [[real number]]s, [[calculus]] or [[Euclidean geometry]]. Discrete objects can often be [[enumerate]]d by integers; more formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with [[countable set]]s (finite sets or sets with the same [[cardinal]]ity as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics".[5]

The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be [[finite]] or [[infinit]]e. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to [[business]].

Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of [[digital]] [[Comput]]s which operate in "discrete" steps and store [[data]] in "discrete" [[bit]]s. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of [[computer science]], such as computer [[algorithm]]s, [[programming language]]s, [[cryptography]], automated [[theorem]] proving, and [[software development]]. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems.

Although the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from "continuous" mathematics are often employed as well.
