#Geography 
Geography is a field of [[science]] devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of [[Earth]]. The first recorded use of the word γεωγραφία was as a title of a book by [[Greek]] scholar [[Eratosthenes]]. Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its [[human]] and natural complexities—not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other [[celestial body]] (bodies) in the field of [[planet]]ary [[science]].[2] One such concept, the first [[law]] of geography, proposed by Waldo Tobler, is "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."[3][4] Geography has been called "the world discipline" and "the bridge between the human and the [[physical]] sciences."
