[[Software]] is a set of [[Comput]] programs and associated documentation and data.[1] This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work.

At the lowest [[programming]] level, executable code consists of [[Machine Language]]instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit ([[CPU (central processing unit)]]) or a [[graphics]] processing unit ([[GPU]]). Machine language consists of groups of [[binary]] values signifying [[processor]] instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example, displaying some text on a computer screen, causing state changes that should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction or is interrupted by the[[ operating system]]. As of 2023, most personal computers, [[smartphone]] devices, and [[server]]s have processors with multiple execution units, or multiple processors performing computation together, so computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.

The majority of software is written in [[high-level]] [[programming language]]s. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to [[natural language]]s than machine languages.[2] High-level languages are translated into machine language using a [[compile]], an [[interpret]], or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a [[low-level]] [[Assembly Language]] that has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an [[assembler]].
