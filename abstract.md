#Math 
In [[software]] [[engineering]] and computer science, abstraction is:

The process of removing or generalizing [[physical]], [[spatial]], or [[temporal]] details or attributes in the study of objects or systems to focus attention on details of greater importance; it is similar in nature to the process of generalization;
the creation of abstract [[concept-object]]s by mirroring common features or attributes of various non-abstract objects or systems of study â€“ the result of the process of abstraction.
Abstraction, in general, is a fundamental concept in [[computer science]] and software development. The process of abstraction can also be referred to as modeling and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design. Models can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality.

Abstraction in computer science is closely related to abstraction in [[math]]ematics due to their common focus on building abstractions as objects, but is also related to other notions of abstraction used in other fields such as [[art]].

Abstractions may also refer to real-world objects and [[system]]s, rules of computational systems or rules of [[programming language]]s that carry or utilize features of abstraction itself, such as:

the usage of data types to perform data abstraction to separate usage from working representations of [[data structure]]s within programs;
the concept of [[procedure]]s, [[function]]s, or [[subroutine]]s which represent a specific way of implementing [[control flow]] in programs;
the rules commonly named "abstraction" that generalize expressions using free and bound [[variable]]s in the various versions of [[lambda calculus]];
the usage of [[S-expression]]s as an abstraction of data structures and programs in the [[Lisp]] programming language;
the process of reorganizing common behavior from non-abstract classes into "abstract classes" using inheritance to abstract over sub-classes as seen in the [[object-oriented]] [[C++]] and [[Java]] programming languages.
