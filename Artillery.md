Artillery is a class of heavy [[military]] ranged [[weapon]]s that launch munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry firearms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach defensive walls and fortifications during [[siege]]s, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery [[cannon]]s developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility generally providing the largest share of an army's total [[firepower]]. Originally, the word "artillery" referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armor. Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, "artillery" has largely meant cannon, and in contemporary usage, usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, and mortars and rocket artillery.
