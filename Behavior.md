**Behaviorism** is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of [[human]]s and other [[animal]]s. It assumes that behavior is either a [reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex "Reflex") evoked by the pairing of certain [antecedent stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antecedent_(behavioral_psychology) "Antecedent (behavioral psychology)") in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's [[history]], including especially [reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_(psychology) "Reinforcement (psychology)") and [punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment_(psychology) "Punishment (psychology)") [contingencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-term_contingency "Three-term contingency"), together with the individual's current [motivational state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivating_operation "Motivating operation") and [controlling stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_control "Stimulus control"). Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of [heredity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity "Heredity") in determining behavior, they focus primarily on [[environment]]al events.
