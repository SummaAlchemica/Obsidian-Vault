#Statistics 
A simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or [[system]] over time.[1] Simulations require the use of [[model]]s; the model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected system or [[process]], whereas the simulation represents the evolution of the model over time. Often, [[Comput]]s are used to execute the simulation.

Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of [[technology]] for performance tuning or optimizing, safety [[engineering]], testing, training, education, and [[video game]]s. Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of [[natural system]]s or [[human system]]s to gain insight into their functioning,[2] as in [[economic]]s. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.[3]

Key issues in modeling and simulation include the acquisition of valid sources of information about the relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviors used to build the model, the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the model, and fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. Procedures and protocols for model verification and validation are an ongoing field of academic study, refinement, research and development in simulations technology or practice, particularly in the work of computer simulation.
