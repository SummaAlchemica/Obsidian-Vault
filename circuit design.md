The process of [[circuit]] design can cover systems ranging from complex [[electronic]] [[system]]s down to the individual [[transistor]]s within an [[integrated circuit]]. One person can often do the design process without needing a planned or structured design process for simple circuits. Still, teams of designers following a systematic approach with intelligently guided computer simulation are becoming increasingly common for more complex designs. In [[integrated circuit design automation]], the term "circuit design" often refers to the step of the design cycle which outputs the [[schematic]]s of the integrated circuit. Typically this is the step between [[logic design]] and physical design.
