The Definition of an Output in [[Math]]
Recall that the output [[variable]] is what comes out of the [[function]]. The output does not have to be a number, but it often is in mathematics. The output is sometimes called the dependent variable because its [[value]] depends on the value of the input.

The output isÂ **how the [[Comput]] presents the results of the process**. Outputs can be returned to the user in many ways such as [[text]] on a [[screen]], printed materials, or as [[sound]] from a speaker.

Output in [[economic]]s is the "quantity of [[good]]s or [[service]]s produced in a given time period, by a [[firm]], [[industry]], or [[country]]", whether [[consume]]d or used for further production. The concept of national output is essential in the field of [[macroeconomics]].
