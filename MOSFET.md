The [[metal]]-[[oxide]]-[[semiconductor]] [[field]]-effect [[transistor]] is a type of field-effect transistor, most commonly fabricated by the controlled oxidation of [[silicon]]. It has an [[insulat]]ed [[gate]], the [[voltage]] of which determines the [[conduct]]ivity of the [[device]]. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for [[amplif]]ying or switching [[electronic]] [[signal]]s. A metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor is a term almost synonymous with MOSFET. Another synonym is IGFET for insulated-gate field-effect transistor. The basic principle of the field-effect transistor was first patented by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925. The main advantage of a MOSFET is that it requires almost no input current to control the load current, when compared with [[bipolar transistor]]s. In an enhancement mode MOSFET, voltage applied to the gate terminal increases the conductivity of the device. In depletion mode transistors, voltage applied at the [[gate]] reduces the conductivity.
